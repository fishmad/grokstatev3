# Quick Start for Copilot AI and New Developers

Welcome to the grokstatev3 project! This guide helps any new Copilot AI or developer get up to speed quickly, regardless of which machine or VS Code instance you are using.

## 1. Where to Find Project Context

- **Project Status:** See `.github/STATUS.md` for a dated summary of completed steps, current progress, and next steps.
- **Build Steps:** See `.github/BUILD_ORDER.md` for the canonical build order, Copilot prompts, and file modification history.
- **Coding Standards & Conventions:** See `.github/COPILOT_STANDING_ORDER.md` for all naming conventions, architectural rules, and tech stack details.

## 2. How to Sync Progress Between Machines

- Always `git pull` before starting work on a new machine.
- Always `git add . && git commit -m "Update status/progress" && git push` after making changes.
- Keep `.github/STATUS.md` and `.github/BUILD_ORDER.md` up to date as you complete steps.

## 3. For Copilot AI

- Read `.github/STATUS.md` and `.github/BUILD_ORDER.md` before generating code or answering questions.
- Follow all coding standards in `.github/COPILOT_STANDING_ORDER.md`.
- Use the provided Copilot prompts in `.github/BUILD_ORDER.md` for consistent code generation.

## 4. For Human Developers

- Review the same files above for project context, standards, and next steps.
- If you add new features or complete steps, update `.github/STATUS.md` and commit your changes.

## 5. Troubleshooting

- If Copilot AI seems unaware of project context, paste the contents of `.github/STATUS.md` and `.github/BUILD_ORDER.md` into your prompt or chat.
- For new Copilot AIs, always start by reading these files.

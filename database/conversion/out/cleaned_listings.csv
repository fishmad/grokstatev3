The lower bedroom is a very decent double bedroom with the upper being the larger master with a storage area and effectively an en-suite.
Both bedrooms have a sliding door to their own private balcony.
Rooms are fitted with individual locks so that two independent parties are able to rent simultaneously should that be the desire of the landlord.
The furniture included in the sale is high quality as this apartment was originally destined for the short term holiday stay market to maximise income. Whereas the apartment is ideally located for this purpose long terms rentals are still in the region of an attractive $500 per week. ($250 per person).
It is located in one of the best spots in Adelaide with central market and China-town being only a couple of minutes walk.","1022","1087"

This 3 bedroom house would have to be one of the cheapest in the Illawarra. It would make a great little rental property for someone on a budget, at only $266,000. Or, if you're a first home buyer, with a little bit of work updating the interior, this could be a great investment for your future. Either way, 3 bedroom houses at this price don't come along every day, so grab yourself a bargain while you can.
The home has views to Port Kembla's coastline as well as escarpment views.
The 3 bedroom home is constructed of Hardi Plank with a tile roof and is situated on a 545.6m2 block.
If money's tight now that the interest rates have peaked, why not organise to inspect this home today.

Just around the corner is a child care center and across the road from that is the well respected Aged Care Facility ( Chelsea Retirement Village ).
Bus access Just around the corner or only a 800m walk to Station square shopping Complex to catch the main bus that runs every hour to Hervey Bay to go for a dip.
At the shopping center you will find Coles, Big W, Dr Surgery, Pharmacy,Dentist, News Agent, Hairdressers, Tobacconist, Bottle Shop,Best and Less, Sanity,NAB, Multiple Clothes Shops,Optus Center, Sports Power, The Reject Shop, Bakers Delight, Prouds Jewelers, Michael Hill and a whole heap more.
Oh did I mention that a 80m walk will get you to Bunnings Garden Center entrance and a walk of about 150m will get you to both Maccas and Hungry Jacks and just go another 120m across from Maccas and you will be right on the door step of Aldi ready to grab an early bird bargain.
Just google map this address and you will be amazed at all the stores located in close proximity.It truly is the ultimate place for a retired couple who no longer drive and are looking to keep their independence by walking to the shops and stores for services and goods.
This is also a great location for a dual working couple who work a lot or come home late and need a place that is walking distance to the Schools so their kids can walk safely to school and then home again thus lessening the burden of picking up and dropping off kids to school.
This place screams potential and also has a entertainment area with concreted floor extended out the back to host large family BBQ's or party nights.
The yard is big enough for the most active kids and has an area off to the side that has been used as a compost pit and for growing veges.
The house itself has 4 comfortable bedrooms, 3 showers and 3 toilets.
5 ceiling fans and 4 reverse cycle air conditioners.
New modern kitchen with walk through pantry into the separate dining room.
New corrugated iron roof and concrete stumps throughout.
Double lock up garage with remote doors and separate powered workshop.
All security screens fitted allowing windows to be opened all year round without fear of pesky insects coming in.
A clean tidy house with nothing to do other than move in and enjoy.
An inspection is a must as some of the photos I have taken,just do not do this property justice.
If great value and prime location to shops is what you are after then you do not have to look any further...You have found this hidden Gem.","1037","1102"

"283409","full_desc","Buy into a part of a proud Strata Scheme. Unlike many in the area, many of the occupants of 34 Moore are owner occupiers. As a result, major capital works have already been done and some are underway - the future of this strata scheme is one of low maintenance, low interruptions and hence, lower costs.
In it’s recent history, a new driveway and new glass balconies were installed to replace the original. To comply with new Strata Laws, child safe aluminium windows are currently being installed throughout the building and the old windows in this unit (17) have already been replaced.
Equally, the unit itself has had a major rejuvenation since being built and even minor details have been attended to.
Unit 17 is positioned on the third floor, the top floor of the building. It includes an internal Laundry, combined Living and Dining with a generous Balcony, two Bedrooms and Bathroom with shower, bath, toilet and vanity. On the Ground Floor, adjacent to the entry to the building is an undercover car space and storage room. There is also some visitors parking available at the rear of the building.
NBN is available from the Lounge area, and the electricity power board inside the unit has had a complete overhaul in December 2016 to ensure all power points are wired through safety switches. Water efficient water fittings are installed in the bathroom and kitchen.
Only the double brick walls remain from the original build - though, they have been freshly painted. The floors are durable vinyl with 24 years warranty remaining.
Both bedrooms are fitted with large, mirrored built in robes and near new window covers are installed throughout.
Recent bank valuations have placed this unit comfortably above the mid 300’s so this is great value buying in a central location.

The Numbers:
Current tenant is paying 330.00 per week.
Strata is 797.46 per quarter - including the capital works levies.
Council rates are 269.20 per quarter
Water rates are 180.00 per quarter.

To respect the privacy of the tenant, inspections are only through the open home at 10:30am on Saturdays until sold. First Open Home is 16 September 2017.

This home has lovely vistas from each window, is cool in summer and warm in winter. You will hardly need to light the wood heater. It has plenty of rooms and spaces to raise your family and you have the park for the kids to fly a kite, play cricket or football. You really won't find another like it and there is only one neighbour. What more could you want? Loved by first family for over 60 years. The much loved gardens with flower, fruit and vegetable now need a little TLC to bring them back to their glory.
This home has a formal dining and lounge rooms, 4 Bedrooms, two with built ins. The fourth bedroom is very large and has been used as both a bedroom and family room over the years. The home also has an additional large room that has been used as both a workshop and storage room. With little effort this room has the great potential for many things such as an additional 5 bedroom, family room, or halve it and keep the workshop and have a small 5th bedroom. You could also open up this room to the 4th bedroom and then create a self sufficient flat, student accommodation or B&B for extra income since both rooms have their own individual access doors. Alternatively, why not turn the extra large 4th bedroom into a teenager’s retreat or grandparent’s room and keep the large workshop area for mum or dad or both. This home has a lot of potential to make changes to suit your own living space needs and desires at a minimal cost of time and money.
The home also has a fenced, private backyard with a great entertaining deck overlooking gardens and parkland. Secure carport at the front with side access to the backyard. Backyard has the potential for many things even for a two bay shed and it comes with large water tank and garden shed.
With walking distances to all Harristown Schools and close to a Bus stop at the end of the street, you can keep the car at home. Close to the Base Hospital.
Only 5 mins to the city, the University, all major Toowoomba Shopping Centres, the iconic Japanese Gardens and Laurel Bank Park. A Catholic Church is 50 metres away and within a few minutes walk, there is an Anglican Church. Position, Position, Position!","1087","1147"

As you drive down the long winding driveway you will feel as though you've stepped back in time. This house is the original ""Farmer Brown"" farm house and has been fully restored to its former glory.
Built over three floors, this large 4 bedroom home is built of quality timber and finishes. It features high ceilings, ornate cornices, ceiling roses, precious light fittings and hardwood timber floors throughout.
The huge master bedroom features an ensuite, walk-in wardrobe and french doors leading out onto a private balcony. The home has two seperate living areas, formal dining room, and a spacious kitchen. The large fireplace in the main lounge room heats the entire house in winter, and the large windows are great for capturing the sea breezes. There's also a large wrap around verandah to sit and enjoy those summer evenings. On the 4th level is a huge attic, which can extend the size of this already large house.
The gardens are well established and feature large water ponds with Koi fish, rose garden, entertainment area, veggie patch, deep water well with pump (underground water supply), a large double shed and two large lock up garages. To help you maintain the property there is a ride on lawn mower and water vacuum for the ponds included in the sale.
The house is situated on a corner block with a reserve at the rear and only one neighbour. The beach is only a short 10 minute stroll away and the property has views over the creek and wet lands nearby. Located only 1 minute drive to the shopping centre and main street.
This property will have you falling in love with it at first sight as it's full of character from a bygone era.

"290413","full_desc","Derby is now recognised as one of the best Mountain Bike destinations in the world.
The once sleepy township is struggling to keep up with the demand for accommodation and this demand is set to continue as the number of tracks in planning and construction are completed.
Derby is currently the fastest growing tourist hotspot in Tasmania.
This generously proportioned block of 1920 sq metres is located adjacent to the Tasman Highway, the only road in and out of Derby.
The block is flat to gently sloping with rich well drained soil unlike most of Derby which is built on exposed rock and is expensive or unviable to build on.
The block has approx 2 Ha of Crown land on either side which could be leased now or in the future at a small annual fee.
Behind the block is a vast area of native forest with majestic Eucylpts, towering manferns and massive granite outcrops.
5 minutes walk eastward leads to Valley Ponds, a 5ha lake and wetlands area teaming with platypus ideal for canoeing and swimming.
The Ringarooma River, home to the annual Derby River Derby , is a 5 minute walk to the north.
The block is just 3 minutes drive to the central hub of Derby, offering a convenient escape from the crowds.
This would make an excellent block for Eco pods.
The Zoning is Rural Resources which encourages Tourist Accommodation.
Be quick as Derby properties are selling fast.","1100","1067"

With no time limit to build and many building companies now building at Point Boston, you can be enjoying your beach house within months. Or you can take advantage of some of Port Lincoln’s great architects and build a masterpiece. The choice is yours.
Point Boston Peninsula is criss crossed with walking trails linking spectacular hidden beaches and coves and boasts some of the states best fishing.
With a 1117sm block there is plenty of room for the boat and the extended family to come and visit. Point Boston has been developed with the environment and the future in mind. The gentle slope of the land and single storey restriction for front blocks means these views will be yours to treasure forever.
Don’t delay opportunities like this don’t come by every day.","1115","1171"

"295352","full_desc","This split level home is recently renovated and surrounded by lovely, quiet neighbours. The established garden (front and rear) is designed for privacy and for children. The sunlight floods in each room through the extra large windows, with the backroom looking out over the huge shade tree and tree house in the backyard. The yard is flat and currently comfortably holds a 15ft tramp and swing set with still plenty of room to kick a ball around and play tip. It's a short walk to the local oval, netball courts, PCYC and skate park - with a park and stores (grocery, butcher, Fish'n Chips, coffee shop and hairdressers) a few blocks down.White walls throughout so it is a blank canvas for the next owners. The bus service for community and school stops just around the corner. There are 3 primary schools close by. This is a wonderfully happy place for the current owners who are only moving to live closer to family. This home has surprising more space than the exterior shows and you are going to love it. Don't miss it.
Photo's before renovation still on Domain.com.au - this family home has come a long way.

We live in the comfortable brick veneer house at the entrance to the property which could do with a modern renovation.
Over the years I have built three relocatable dwellings amongst the trees which are rented out for a total of $370 per week.
We would like to sell then rent back for $300 per week, this would provide a potential rental income of $670 per week. This would provide a decent investment with very good capital growth being only 16km from Brisbane CBD.

The ability to truly get away from it all is a rarity these days, but this daydream-perfect, off-grid, cosy and self sufficient property on 100 acres, nestled at the end of a mountain valley is pure magic.
A quaint 2 bedroom, 1 bathroom plus study, or 3rd bedroom, logged home with a decent-sized, native-timber verandah overlooking sandstone escarpment and thousands of trees across the valley.
Large corrugated iron machinery shed, secure & stable structure. Chook & wood shed also.
A little logged cabin suitable for guests, visitors or a perfect teenager retreat.
Sustainable
3 rain & spring fed water tanks, 25000, 10000L, and a 5000L self-filling house header tank = 40000LT. About six month's of water storage. Clean mountain valley air, springwater to not only drink but bathe, cook and water the veggies with!
Dam & bore also on the property. Dam has filled & remained full for months at times. Spring (located on neighbouring property) has flowed on the property a few times forming a glorious creek.
Organic veggie patch & organic fruit trees, wild bush tucker & wild medicinal herbs, growing in some of the most fertile valley blacksoil you've ever seen.
Completely off-grid set up, near new 3.5kw (3.5yr old), quality solar array. 36kWh of batteries. Can supply an average of 7kWh/day usable in winter and 12kWh/day in summer. Sinewave inverter can supply up to 3.6kW continuous power. Battery life up to three days of complete overcast. Reasonably efficient new 2.8kW generator (0.5L/hr) and quality 1.2kW battery charger for the handful of times you will need to top up the batteries.
We run dishwashers, air conditioner, kettles & coffee machines. Just not all at once!
Spilt System energy efficient inverter airconditioner has been installed in the main living area. Ceiling fans to main living space & bedroom. A quality woodstove heats the whole house in winter, and with 50 acres of pristine and heavily wooded bush, you'll never want for quality firewood.
Land
50% clear valley floor and 50% bushland with wattles, grevilleas, red, yellow & white box (eucalypt) trees. Plus many, many more. The sandstone escarpment all around is breath-taking.
Bushwalking, rock climbing, cave exploring, hiking. So much wildlife with wombats, birds, kangaroos, wallabies, and wallaroos. It really is like living in a national park, a naturalist and birdwatchers' paradise. The starry nights have to be seen to be believed.
Area
The local people are absolutely wonderful. Everyone looks out for each other in every sense, with regular catchups and neighbourly visits.
This beautiful piece of heaven is located just NE of wine country and 44km by road to Mudgee which is a picturesque country town, with many of the amenities of much larger regional centres and a burgeoning gourmet paradise!
Closer to home is the historic Cooyal Pub. Imagine settling down to a coffee or a countermeal in this quintessential bush pub on the banks of the Cooyal Creek, and in the winter by an open fire!
The local Cooyal Hall has tennis courts, hosts weekly playgroups for families, as well as multiple special events throughout the year, and just built a full undercover playground with bbq and picnic tables for all to use!
Castle Rock, and also Goulburn River & The Drip National Parks, are just some of the magical places to explore & take a dip.

"303997","full_desc","This unique three-storey townhouse is located high on the hill, in an area known to be part of the dress circle of South Perth.
The property is one of four in a well-appointed complex, all uniquely designed and very private. It offers city and casino views as well as the convenience of being around the corner from the Angelo Street village and shopping precinct.
The property has twin garages, laundry, a small workshop (with power) and an excellent area for storage which might also be a wine cellar, all on the ground floor.
The corporate body fees are minimal (insurance only) as the owners generally maintain their properties themselves, each with their own driveways, courtyards, gardens and storage areas. Documentation from the South Perth Council outlining the steps to take should you wish to convert from strata to green title is also available for your consideration.
After entering through the remote-controlled garage door, you park your vehicle and walk up the newly carpeted stairs to enter the living areas. As you take in the views from the back balcony or maybe stepping onto the front balcony, you might then decide to discard the duties of the day upstairs in the study and freshen up in the newly renovated bathroom. There are views of the city with afternoon sun in the master bedroom and the second bedroom which has views of the casino and is accompanied by the morning sun.
This is a once in a twenty-year opportunity to become an owner of a spacious modern townhouse within a small complex.
See for yourself why this townhouse has always been complimented by visitors.","1156","1210"

This DUPLEX APPROVED lot is on the beautiful Waters Edge estate in Bellmere- one of the most upmarket locations in Caboolture. Situated on the Caboolture river front, it faces expansive parklands resembling an acreage , whilst providing the feeling of a secure gated community. Upon completion, this subdivision will have a village and resort lifestyle providing its occupants with uninterrupted panoramic views of the parklands and bush settings on either side of the river. There is also an large iconic fig tree which is now protected and sits on a large park in between the lots and on the other side there is also a walkway along the river.
This property is ideal for families or retirees wanting to downsize from large properties as it provides acreage living without the maintenance. Perfect for those with pets that are used to large blocks of land to run around in! Occupants can enjoy a large council maintained parkland at the doorstep whilst still being in close proximity to the town centre, Bruce Highway, railway, hospital, private schools, Westfield Shopping Centre. Also ideal for professionals who wish to live in a lifestyle environment.
The best way to take advantage of the view would be to have a double storey house with the living area and balcony upstairs facing the river and a pergola at the back to take advantage of the views of the mountain from the back as well. The site is well above the 100 years flood level and was not at all affected in the last floods as the river widens at this point. NBN coming soon.","1157","1211"

We have the perfect lifestyle property that will change the way you live for the better. This 3 bedroom home is built on 13 acres and is situated on beautiful historic Norfolk Island on the edge of the National Park and will never be built out.
Forget the electricity bills – you’ll never receive one living in this eco friendly house. The house is operated solely on solar electricity. But don’t worry, you still have all the modern cons including dishwasher, gas stove, front loading washing machine and upright fridge and freezer. The 3 bedroom house has an open plan living area plus a pool room or family room.
The kitchen is made from locally produced Norfolk Pine and has stainless steel 2 draw dishwasher, stainless steel gas stove, large pantry and island bench. The house comes fully furnished due to the expense of shipping furniture to and from the island. You name it, it’s included right down to the crockery and cutlery. All you’ll need is your clothes! The house also has a combustion fire, solar hot water and is set up and ready for Pay TV.
The property is classed as freehold and includes 2 water tanks, a veggie patch, tractor and 2 cows. Norfolk Island is only 2 hours from Australia in the South Pacific Ocean. The island lies on the Norfolk Ridge which runs from New Zealand to New Caledonia.
It lies 500 miles SSE of Noumea, 700 miles NW of Auckland, 900 miles east of Brisbane and 1100 miles NE of Sydney. It has a subtropical climate with an average rainfall of 1328mm per year. Lovely summer days range from 24 - 28.4 degrees. Mid-winter temperatures range from 19 - 21 degrees during the day.
The current owners set up the property so that they could be fully self sufficient and it is with regret that they are placing the property on the market. This is a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique ECO friendly property on Norfolk Island with loads of potential. Priced at $610,000 For further details please phone 02 4256 0689","118","214"

"344261","full_desc","Our family has enjoyed this ‘unique’ and 'absolute' beachfront holiday home with private access onto the beautiful white and unspoilt sand of Old Bar Beach for many years. Located at 16 Lewis Street, Old Bar is only 3 hours from Sydney, 2 hours from Newcastle or 20 minutes from Taree.
Whatever you are looking for in a holiday Old Bar delivers with surfing right at your back door as well as fishing and kayaking in either the Manning River or Myall Lakes. There are also a wonderful selection of walking trails to explore through the surrounding National Parks. However, if action isn’t what you had in mind then enjoy a slower pace with the joy of peace and quiet where you can re-energise with lazy walks on the beach, reading or cosying up in front of the brand-new wood fireplace during the winter months.
The home is also air-conditioned and has just received a $60k renovation to further enhance its magical setting. The main bedroom is large and takes advantage of stunning ocean views. The second bedroom is great for families and provides two built-in single beds. The house is also wired for cable TV. Downstairs you have the benefits of an oversized open plan space, incorporating a combined kitchen, living and dining area. Also, once again including all those magical ocean views.
Enjoy your perfect family holiday at your own beach pad with all creature comforts and convenience and/or appreciate some additional income with a functioning rental home through HomeAway and Airbnb as le beach shack.
It is fully serviced and if you’re interested we are open to discussions around selling the property fully furnished. If you would like to learn more or would like an inspection please give us a call. You won’t be disappointed.

You've got all the toys, business is successful yet there's no time for living. You want a better quality of life in a small, integrated community. You would love Queensland's best motorcycling roads at your doorstep; an hour from Brisbane Airport and half an hour from the Sunshine Coast beaches.
Simplify life on this gently sloping acre and a half (6000m2) in a cozy yet spacious four bedroom split-pine bungalow with return verandah nestled amongst tall mature trees and abundant birdlife. The pool overlooks your own private patch of remnant rainforest and parkland-like acreage. Relax by the open fire on cooler Glasshouse Mountains Hinterland nights burning your own abundant firewood.
This well-presented, exposed timber ceiling home has a polished slate floor throughout and a renovated red-cedar bathroom, rainwater tanks and good consistent rainfall. The Crohamhurst Conservation Park is only a few minutes walk and ensures limited housing development, maintaining your peace and quiet amongst natural habitat.
Less than 10 minutes away is Beerwah, home of Australia Zoo, that has full amenities of schools, banks, shopping centres and medical clinics, with the new Sunshine Coast Hospital less than half an hour away. Maleny is a gorgeous 20 minute drive away through quiet country roads.
Peachester is a hidden jewel in the crown of the Sunshine Coast Hinterland. This property is waiting for you and will not last long in this sought after area.

The house is full of natural light and splendid views of progress reserve park. Location of the house is paramount. Two train stations are in walking distance to the home. Within half a mile range you can walk to Coolaroo station, Coolaroo South primary school, recreational activities, playing areas, community center, Coolaroo Mosque, Church, convenience store etc.

This house contains 3 bedrooms with 2 having built-in wardrobes and a central storage cupboard outside master bedroom. It has 2 toilets and a bathroom. Open living area takes you to the dining and kitchen area. Kitchen has gas cooking and stainless steel oven. Laundry area opens into the backyard. There is a gate on the driveway which takes you to the covered parking area/shed. House is equipped with a big rain water tank connected with an electric motor. It can save you a lot on your water bills. Brand new central heating system just installed with 5 years warranty. Central cooling system to keep you cool during the summer.

The best thing is that you can live in this house and build another house at the back (STCA) and start earning or convert the shed into granny. There is also potential to augment house from the front as well and increase a bedroom (STCA). The house is renovated last year with new toilet, laundry area, complete house paints etc.

This house will not last long as it stands out from any house in the area because of its superb location.

Don't miss out on this rare opportunity to own such a fantastic home in a brilliant end of a cul-de-sac so close to Queen Street tram station but seems so far.
The entrance to the property is located on the far side of the road so its quiet and private. There is a carport on the side of the lounge room plus space for two to three cars. The garage has been converted into a bedroom with separate access to the back of the property and to the second bathroom.
The property has been completely renovated with beautiful marble-like tiles that enhances its beauty. As soon as you walk in the front door you are introduced to its gleam that raps around to the bedrooms and bathrooms. All bedrooms have built-in wardrobes (except the fourth bedroom), vertical blinds, ceiling fans and are beautifully tiled including the converted garage. The ensuite and second bathroom have been expertly renovated and fitted with high quality fittings.
The lounge is covered by waterproofed wood-like plank vinyl and is easy to clean. The inverter air conditioner in the lounge makes the area very comfortable in winter and summer.
The kitchen has been restored to its original glory with a distinctive hint of dusty violet. It has a wide bench in front for those quick meals for two with lots of space . It also boasts a very reliable dish washer and a large corner pantry.
This home is an entertainer’s dream . An exceptional indoor to outdoor flow from the lounge opens up to the 20 metre squared covered patio at the back which creates an inviting open planed and private space. The area has its own electric outlet for outside cooking and bar fridge. It can hold a good sized group for parties or just friends popping in.

For those who enjoy a bit of growing veggies and plants this home has an garden bed all along the back fence. The shed next to the carport is large enough for all your garden and other tools.
The home is a simple but have a sense of an unadulterated quality about it and can only be fully appreciated by a personal inspection.","1311","1341"

Steeped in history, luxuriously rich volcanic soil and rocks, with rain forest remnants. Awesome views and seclusion.
Internal, boundary and electric fencing is in place. 2 X 20K litre tanks and pressure pump for bore and rainwater.
The homestead is 5 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms and a verandah. Gas hot water and stove. Ceiling fans, concreted area, and double garage (shed). Solar power. The homestead is constructed from hardwood timber, steel and brick stumps; beautiful Crow Ash wood floors. It is not high set, but built onto sloping terrain with storage under the house.
There are two other storage facilities on the property; 1 fully enclosed with entry on 3 sides and electricity connected. The other; open barn style.
The property itself is not conducive to crop growing, slashing or harvesting activities. So much potential though - bush walking, horse riding, mountain biking and motorbiking, B&B, hobby farm, market gardening, permaculture. Or simply sit and take in the awesome views whilst watch the world go by. And of course sales from producing fruit trees.
Bearing fruit trees on the property include:
ïƒ¼ mandarin
ïƒ¼ mulberry
ïƒ¼ custard apple (20)
ïƒ¼ avocado
ïƒ¼guava
ïƒ¼ mango (100 )
ïƒ¼ fig
Schools, shops, produce, mechanics, pharmacy, bakery, post office, groceries, entertainment/pub and fuel are less than 4 kms away. Lots of other historical attractions close by.
I am downsizing enormously and have decided to sell excess items at a clearance sale
I would appreciate your enquiry to explain and discuss my property further.
There is a 23 ton Mitsubishi excavator available for purchase.

We use the East Wing Mostly, and when visitors come, we light the other fire. A brand-new evaporated cooling system is ducted though-out the house. Making it perfect when you are coming in and out of the house from the back deck and pool.
From the kitchen you go onto the back deck with beautiful low maintenance decking. The steel plantation shutters on the west side to stop the hot sun and the breeze in the winter. A timber rail overlooks the incredible garden that is low maintenance and evergreen. Ceiling fans. power points and lighting make it THE place to be all year around. Flowing from the deck there is a solar-heated medium-sized swimming pool built into the ground with 2 large shade sales keeps the sun off when you're hot, perfect for families on hot summer days. This has a brand-new pool pump.
From the deck, follow the undercover walkway to the 6-bay carport with sensor lights and power points for power outside. This runs off the shed of all sheds. This shed is a dream come true for every man with a ceiling fan, loads of power points and a huge work bench leaving plenty of space for the golf cart.
The self-contained Granny flat is used as a beauty salon and candle-making room. This has a huge carpeted living area large enough for a couched area and bedroom. A full kitchen with an electric stove and a combination of tiles and Lino flooring. Large enough for table and chairs plus. In the a bathroom there is a shower, a toilet and laundry troph for your washing machine. Perfect to rent out separately or use for family, friends, or another business. This building has a separate gas hot water system, but the power is connected to the house meter.
There are 2 smaller sheds that houses the extra things attached to the carport. Citrus trees, including limes and lemons, are along the back part of the block and provide fruit for a large part of the year. A brand new massive 9.9kw solar system is on the Beauty salon and is not visible from the house or yard.
This is a beautiful property and we are purchasing another so it needs to go.","1343","1391"

Council Planning approved (expired) architectural plans available. This block has amazing potential with uninterrupted views of the Cape Range to the west and views up the Precinct B canal to the south.
Other blocks in this Maria Precinct currently/recently on the market $700,000 - $800,000.
Why is this block on the mkt a lot cheaper than anything else you ask.
Unfortunately this block is the last of 4 heading back east towards the main road and the floodway that are NOT permitted to build a jetty – this is due to the proximity to the floodway.
But if you’re not intending to build a jetty, it’s a steal","1345","1393"

Off grid, 48 volt system, house runs 240 volt so all normal appliances are to be used. Battery bank is only 12 months old, 12 solar panels.
We run everything here and very rarely need to start generator. There is power very close if wanting to get hooked up, 2 adults and 2 children living here very comfortably. The generator is set up to charge batteries directly, it really is a great system, no power bills. Close to town of Warialda, my son rides his push bike to town.
Perfect location as only 45 mins away from main town of Inverell, Tamworth is only 2 hours and 20 mins, Goondiwindi only 2 hours. Armidale and Glen Innes only 1 hour and 34 mins. Warialda has an IGA , post office, mechanics, coffee shops, 2 hotels, service station, hardware, chemist, Hospital, Age Care facility, motels, caravan parks and other stores. Established vegi gardens, chook pen, house yard is fully fenced.
The 18 acres is fenced but needs repairs to keep in stock, not much left to do. Beautiful flats with black soil ready for growing crops or just running sheep or horses. Plenty of firewood to keep going for years and years, many fruit trees are planted, too many to mention. Easy property to maintain and access around boundary fences.
Rooms in house are small, tiny bedrooms but good cupboard space and hallway storage. Very cosy, just move in and live.
We are happy to let the tractor and slasher go with property. Really need to see this place to appreciate the peace and quiet. no neighbours on either side only one neighbour at back of property but far enough away that you cant see. The Property has a dam which is natural spring fed and always full of water, perfect for livestock. 2 x 5000 gallon water tanks and one 2200 gallon. Very large outdoor entertainment area all under cover, outdoor fireplace, huge roof area and great rain catchment. Tanks have never run dry since we have been here. You can just move in and live. Most of the hard work is done.
The property would be perfect for horses, there is good tree coverage for shade. There is a large undercover area for 2 motor vehicles. There are no flooding issues here and an all weather driveway into property","1364","1410"

"358040","full_desc","Nestled amidst 5 acres of nature sits this beautiful 2 bedroomed two-storey hardwood timber eco home plus a separate cabin, situated within the Lillifield community, a company title community in the Northern Rivers close to Nimbin. Lillifield is seeking community-minded people who are committed to contributing to community life. Lillifield is a strictly dog and cat free community.
The house is fully off-grid (apart from landline/ADSL broadband) and with established gardens, veggie patch and forest is an absolute retreat. Recently renovated (including wiring) with eco products, it offers a mix of rustic and modern open-plan design, the feature stonework and generous use of timber create a natural feel. For those sensitive to Wi-Fi, there are Ethernet network points in the living area and upper bedroom.
The country-style kitchen is well appointed with granite worktops, a large pantry, dishwasher and stunning stone inglenook housing a woodstove with a baker’s oven and wet back for heating water in winter. With a north-easterly aspect and opening onto a covered deck, the kitchen is light-filled during the winter mornings and afternoons catching stunning sunrises through the valley all year round.
With its elevated position, the deck overlooks a tropical garden and the vista stretches over the treetops with glimpses of Blue Knob across the valley. A peaceful place to relax and observe the abundant wildlife.
The light-filled living room has two large windows with views across the treetops, another brand new wood-fire (to be installed) for the winter months and ample space for sofas, a large dining table and office nook. The hardwood flooring, charming timber staircase and character vintage doors enrich the living space.
Off the living room is the downstairs bedroom which features a stonewall and French doors. The master bedroom is a beautiful loft-style room situated upstairs with a large walk-in wardrobe with linen shelves plus a separate storage cupboard doubling as an additional wardrobe. The timber floor and beams create a rustic feel. This open-plan space also has the potential for conversion into two rooms.
The hallway offers an alternative entrance (if the buyer wishes to complete the small veranda that the downstairs bedroom and bathroom would also open out onto). The bathroom is luxurious with an antique cast-iron claw-foot bath from which you will enjoy rainforest views large through large French doors and floor-to-ceiling sash windows. The easy-access shower includes a rainfall and hand-held showerhead and the vanity, custom-made from vintage drawers with a ceramic basin, is framed by beautiful glass light pendants. The hallway also provides access to a well-appointed composting loo with hand basin and a separate laundry with custom-made sink unit, handmade tiles, a washing machine and space for a dryer (above counter).
In addition to the main house, this property offers a separate single-room cabin (no power) with wooden floors and a veranda providing an additional guest bedroom or studio overlooking the fruit trees (citrus, mango and olive). At the back of the cabin is the carport accessed from the driveway, which has ample parking space. A stepping stone path leads from the carport to the home's entrance winding past lush garden and the lemon tree.
To the south of the house is a fenced veggie patch with a netted veggie tunnel and there is potential to connect to the nearby community dam for additional water supply. The surrounding forest provides all your firewood needs.
Extra Features: 3.5kw solar system (7 years old) with 2.8kw inverter and 1000 amp hour energy gel batteries, 3 year old Bosch gas water heater. The external hardwood cladding has just been treated with two coats of an eco non-VOC product. Internal floors treated with ‘Livos’ brand eco floor oil. Internal walls painted with eco non-toxic paint.
The property is listed “As is” as there are a couple of outstanding jobs to complete including a French drain and possibly additional bracing of the steel footings. The brand new wood-heater in the lounge requires a ‘dog-leg’ section to connect with the existing flue system. A small deck at the rear would complete the renovation.
Near-by amenities include:
Barkers Vale Primary School next door to the community entrance
Rainbow Ridge Steiner School 5 mins drive
Local General Store (Wadeville Woolies) 5 mins drive
Hanging Rock swimming hole (8 mins drive)
Nimbin village 15 mins drive
Kyogle 25 mins drive
Murwillumbah / Lismore 45 mins drive
Lillifield is a beautiful company-title community offering over 8km of internal roads and fire trails for walking and a swimming dam. It has its own community centre for events/workshops/gatherings and offers many community resources including two tractors. Lillifield is STRICTLY cat and dog free. The community relies on voluntary input from shareholders to function and has a variety of committees that organise getting the jobs done. You can find out more about joining Lillifield community through the website and its ‘introduction to buying onto Lillifield’ found here www.lillifield.net.au/for-sale-on-lillifield

Multiple dwellings on separate titles, with new building entitlements still available on individual title holdings. Registered easement road connects several lots.
This gorgeous park like homestead includes a heritage style 4 bedroom homestead as well as a fully functional cottage, built on a stunning green rolling landscape displaying gorgeous views from every angle. The property has been long established in the historic Sandy Flat area in the Northern Rivers, and is close to the booming township of Tenterfield NSW 2372. Embellished in new England style landscaping and horticulture, the property has been carefully planted with deciduous trees and fruiting mulberries to compliment the green pasture and grazing lifestyle. Meandering down the scenic driveway, colours change throughout the seasons as the Liquidambars (sweetgum) turn from green to red signalling the coming winter, the beauty of the farm here really is sensational year round!
Originally a sheep and ram stud, the land has exceptional grazing and is well watered with 7 dams, 3 genuine fresh water springs and seasonal run-off tributaries that course over little rock waterfalls. There are also several rain water tanks, amounting to over 60,000L of rain water storage, with options to increase by adding tanks to the sheds and garage, although owners have stressed the point that they have never run out of water even during the worst droughts.
The property boasts all new main water lines throughout the whole property, bringing water to every paddock to service the needs of animals and installed with the intention of establishing more fruit and nut tree orchards in the fields.
Steel post eco-board and Timber house with Hardwood front and rear decks raised off the ground for Termite proofing and view vantage. The house is fully insulated, very sturdy and well constructed by a licensed builder with over 60 years experience. Country homestead feel with ergonomic design, there is plenty of functional storage throughout the house. Open plan kitchen and living, warmed in winter by a wood stove fireplace with private bedrooms that open each side of the house onto the wide verandahs. Laundry and muck-off room at the rear entry to the house keep muddy feet clean, with additional freezer and storage space. 2 generous master bedrooms at opposite ends of the house make for a very spacious and private living arrangement, complimenting the cozy feel to the home. The entire house has recently been repainted inside and professionally cleaned throughout.
Proven primary production income from the established dog boarding / breeding kennels on the property with annual income as accounted averaging 150k annual. Premises is less than 2 years old and custom designed for low maintenance and to meet the environmental and behavioral needs of dogs. All steel and hardwood design, with lush grass and big iron-bark trees giving shade. If little dogs are not your thing, the area could also be used to keep miniature goats, sheep, ponies or for market gardens etc. Infrastructure cost over 180k to build in 2020, owners are now retiring after many years due to family circumstances changing.
Multiple fully fenced pastures support rotational grazing for cattle (up to 50 head), horses, sheep, donkeys, alpacas and a few families of native wallabies, kangaroo, goanna and echidna. Big old shade trees are spread out nicely in the fields and are home to the occasional koala sighted, while hardwood forest of stringy and iron bark surround the vista. Firebreaks have been maintained along the perimeter, and the Sandy Flat Rural Fire Station is right across the road for an added sense of safety.
Electric front gate allows for easy access when returning home from town, and provides extra security / private access for studio guests. Rustic sandstone pillars greet you when entering the property, with a private entrance right off the New England Hwy. Just 13 minutes to Tenterfield Town, with schools, Coles, arts centre, hardwares, library, cafes, cinema, pizza!

This could be the property of your dreams – a low-maintenance one-bedroom home with a huge deck, workshop, and tonnes of undercover parking.
Perfectionists can keep scrolling, but if you’re a fixer or a handyman the house could use a lick of paint, plastering, a new kitchen, and some weatherboards – however, it is perfectly habitable for those looking to move in immediately.
The property comes with two garages and two carports, as well as a large concreted area and lawns for dogs to enjoy. The main garage is a large two-car shed with automatic remote roller doors and plenty of space for extra storage, a workspace, and a hoist, while the smaller garage can house two vehicles. There’s also a two-space carport behind gates, and a three-space carport at the front of the house. That’s undercover parking for nine vehicles or more.
The home comes with a new corrugated iron roof, near new carpets and curtains throughout, a split-system air conditioner in the lounge room, a split-system air conditioner in the bedroom, a renovated bathroom with spa bath, a generous laundry, a gas hot water service with good pressure, wheelchair access, and an alarm system. The home is very well insulated in summer and winter, and the sun hits the shower in the mornings, while the living areas provide glimpses of the sunsets at dusk. The south side of the house has privacy screens partially erected along the fenceline.
The deck is perfect for entertaining year round, with enough space for an outdoor dining setting, BBQ, or an outdoor cinema or gym.
Just 2.5 hours from Melbourne, this property is located in a close-knit community with Coles, Woolworths, IGA, Aldi, Target, McDonalds, KFC, Subway, as well plenty of choice for take-away, cafes, and restaurants.
A short drive to world-class hunting and camping in the Victorian High Country, this area is perfect for those who love the outdoors, fishing, or boating, with plenty of space to keep your gear. Drive down after work on Friday, hit the mountains over the weekend, and have somewhere to shower and leave your stuff before heading home. Or simply move in and enjoy the spoils 365 days a year.
The house can come fully or partially furnished, with a 65-inch TV, entertainment unit, Yamaha 5.1 surround sound system, L-shaped couch with fold-out inner-spring mattress and ottoman, sideboard with wine rack, dining table and chairs, desk and chair, three-door side-by-side fridge/freezer, microwave, toaster, kettle, air fryer, coffee machine, pots and pans, cutlery, double bed, side table, five-piece outdoor dining setting, small electric safe, rifle safe, ammo safe, and a washer/dryer all available.

"367552","full_desc","Here is a place where you can truly get away from everyone. 583Acres (on 2 titles) with frontage to the Wentworth river. There are very few properties on the Wentworth this being the largest and surrounded by Forest on all boundaries. Access is only by 4X4 and the nearest neighbor is 9 km away. Peaceful,suriene and beautiful are just some of the words that describe this place. The Wentworth catchment is one of the most intact pristine catchments in the country with full forest cover, you can drink the water in the river which also holds brown trout. There is heaps of native wildlife including wombats, kangaroos, wallabies, many species of birds, even the odd emu YES you occasionally see them. There are also Deer for those who love to hunt as well as feral cattle.
The property has previously been used for sheep and there is a 9mX9m old very solid shearing shed that could be converted to a 2 bed cabin. While fences are there they will need redoing if it is your aim to run any livestock.
We have had this place over 10 yrs and only selling to help the kids into a house. Serious enquiries only please, inspections will be by prior arrangement.

A unique styled home externaly, equally impressive is the interior, offering Native Blackbutt Hybrid flooring, soft-grey carpeted bedrooms, modern tiling in the bathrooms and laundry with gorgeous green backsplash tiles in the kitchen.
Neighbouring properties considered privacy in their designs and the way the living spaces were planned, sitting in any room or out on the deck you can’t see anyone.
This home offers a floor space of 205sqm, a double garage with a flat driveway, plus an underfloor area complete with lockable roller door which has a massive storage space for all those items you don’t want filling up your garage!
High 2.55m ceilings and dual stacker doors which open up to the 10metre deck which is fabulous for catching those sea breezes in summer with little need for an air conditioner, but for those humid days a 6kw split system is installed in the lounge/dining area which covers the whole house with ease.
Natural light was a prerequisite for this home and the high level of glass in the living space commands this without any sun directly shining in except at sunset and gives you a feeling of space with beautiful views to the mountains and the most amazing sunsets.
Four well sized bedrooms, master bedroom has an oversized shower. No internal stairs, from the internal access garage all access to the home is on the flat. There’s a toilet and wash basin at the front of the home, an ensuite which runs off the master bedroom, and a full sized bathroom as well, so never a queue for the bathroom or loo!
Location – a 7 minute walk to beautiful Denham’s beach, through the reserve and down the hill, the Sunshine Bay Estate has wide, low traffic roads and has footpaths which is rare in the area, great for walking the dog or taking the kids for a walk in a quiet, relaxed environment.
Looking for an ultra-modern home which is ready to move into? Want a place you can have the whole family with plenty of space or even a lucrative Airbnb with friendly and respectful neighbours both sides. This home really is the home you have been looking for!

"43993","full_desc","Looking for more space or have a growing family? Then this spacious 4 bedroom brick house could be just what you’re looking for.
With three separate living areas there’s plenty of space to spread out or give the kids room to run around. The lounge room has that cosy feel with a slow combustion wood fire and brick feature wall. The rumpus room has a nice outlook through the large 4m wide glass sliding doors which open onto the verandah. The family room is large, with a dining area at one end opposite the kitchen, and a study area at the other. The kitchen has been recently renovated and has a pantry, dishwasher and breakfast bar. All the living areas, dining and kitchen are tiled, plus there’s a reverse cycle air conditioner in the kitchen and a ceiling fan in the lounge room. There are 4 good sized bedrooms, two with built-in wardrobes. The three way bathroom upstairs has also been recently renovated and has a stylish polyurethane vanity and separate toilet.
Downstairs is an oversized (1 ¾ size) single garage which has been converted into a music studio. So, whether you need a spot for the car or the drum kit – this house delivers. The studio walls are easily removed and converted back to a garage. But, if you’re a professional muso, garage rock band or karaoke queen this studio could be your heart’s desire. With acoustic bats and gyprock, it’s 70% sound proofed, so you could belt out a song or two at 2am and the neighbours will never know. Apart from the studio, there is a mixing room, lounge area, toilet and separate shower.
Outside, the house features a sunny courtyard off the dining area plus a good sized yard. The house sits on a large corner block, and has gates and side access on both sides of the house, plus a new garden shed. The front yard has been landscaped and is low maintenance.
Houses of this size and quality are hard to find in this price bracket. Definitely one to take a look at during an Open For Inspection, or arrange a personal inspection today. For further details please phone 0418 148 194","22","1"

The veiws are stunning and encompass near 360degrees, yet privacy is absolute.The structure is unique in that is built of ""Hebel"" blocks. this is a lightweight concrete possessing remarkable qualities of themal and sound insulation, making it a delight to live in. The outer walls are solid and eight inch thick [inner walls a mix of four and six with large tinted windows imbedded into the blockwork. Worries about fire are lessened by the fact that Hebel is virtually fireproof.The home has been owner built with meticulous care over eight years, completion being 2004.The house has been architectually designed in a boomerang shape to take advantage of the panoramic veiws. The front faces north, the rear south; tracking the sun from sunup to sundown, a lovely feature during a cold winter. The envioronment is peace and tranquility, and feels remote, yet five minutes away by car is a busy regional shopping centre. Hobart is within 30 minutes and the airport 15 minutes. Also, within 15 minutes are four golf courses and two beaches. There are two sheds and a large 8m x 9m workshop/garage which is part of the house. The workshop has an automtive pit, wood heater, shower and toilet, remotelly controlled 5m panel lift door and 3 phase power. This could easily be converted to a flat, which it was for three years while the house was being built. A large kitchen with granite bench tops is part of an open plan encompassing dining and family rooms, including a heat pump, or reverse cycle air conditioner. Off this is a formal dining and lounge area, with a wood heater; another large area. the main bedroom is complete with an ensuite and walkin robe. The remaining two bedrooms are equipped with builtin robes. The roomy study could also become a fourth bedroom, if required. The bathroom is fully tiled and comes with a large spa bath.The water tank is huge, 20000 gallons, and is buried alongside a fertile vegetable garden amidst large landscaped gardens. With so much water capacity and a roof offering so much catchment area, water is not a problem.","266","370"

"35087","full_desc","A domestic cleaning franchise with 40 regular clients, and a guaranteed gross weekly minimum income of $1300. This is the perfect business to shape around your lifestyle. A first business owners dream opportunity. It’s a simple business to run, and it will give you a great start in the small business bull ring. As Canberra has a high population of public servants and working parents, we are constantly turning back jobs that we just cannot fill, so you are guaranteed never to run out of work. For the entrepreneurs among us, it’s a franchise with enormous potential to expand and hire. 3 years ago it was said that over 400 cleaners would be needed to fill the need in Canberra. Judging by the amount of requests we get for our services, that demand has only grown.There is the added bonus of having the successful and trustworthy name of VIP behind you. Franchisee support is excellent, with area meetings tri-monthly. The VIP head office does all the major advertising, with all enquiries going through the central call centre, then on to you via SMS. It’s convenient - and it works.We have a solid, regular customer base which will be included in the sale, as is all equipment. You will also receive 4 weeks training before starting.

Good size bedrooms, 3 split system air conditioners throughout and a newly renovated bathroom.
With Major re-development of road systems nearby you will be quick smart to access all areas across Perth. This house will afford you a great lifestyle but also has many short to long term investment reasons for purchasers... It is located in development area 6 that is favorable for higher density zoning or land use amendments, meaning in the future you may consider subdividing the block and capitalizing on the development potential while still earning rental income in the short term.

"319973","full_desc","Brand new 25 year lease has been created for this growing business, however the owners will consider offers for the freehold.. The caravan park has been successfully run by a couple for the last 8 years and during this time the turnover has grown from $76,000 to (projected for 2012 year) $300,000. The excellent location just off the highway and close to the clubs and shops makes it a very popular stopping point for the thousands of travelers moving north and south each year. The cabin business has a steady income from traveler’s and local miners, (the new Tomingley gold mine is starting just 15K up the road) and boosted by events like the Elvis festival in Parkes. A unique tourist attraction 'The Big Fish Fossil Hut' has recently been added to the park. Extra land has been purchased for an extension to the park to cater for the growing number of 'gray nomads' who are finding it more and more difficult and expensive to stop in parks along the coast. Currently the park is licensed for 34 sites however the additional land will enable it to go to around 50 sites.
The convenient store located in the office area of the caravan park is now established as a very popular shop for the local Peak Hill community. The operators residence is a 2 bedroom house attached to the shop/office for easy access during open hours.
The park has many other features that make it very popular with the traveling public, interested persons please contact the owner for further details.","455","550"

"116931","full_desc","This is a rare opportunity to purchase on the escarpment overlooking Perth. Expansive views West to Rottenest Island, South to Kwinana, and North to Wanerooo. Lots of water views – Perth waters, Matilda Bay and lots of the near horizon showing the ocean. On clear days you can see the sandhills on Rottenest.This 4x2 brick and tile home has been extensively remodelled. The kitchen has been updated to include large ceramic sinks and a brand new 900 mm Smeg stainless steel stove (gas cooktop/forced fan oven). Both toilets have been replaced, and there are new matching light fixtures throughout the home. The roof has been professionally restored.Colourbond gutter and downpipes have also been relaced. There is a reverse cycle air conditioner in the family room and the formal lounge has a heat form fireplace (the heat form is an efficient open fronted pot belly that heats the air and also provides radiated heat from the steel enclosure).The home includes a formal lounge, kitchen/dining room, family/theatre room, and a large laundry room. The master bedroom has an en-suite and large walk-in-robe.All rooms are protected by an advanced alarm system that includes motion sensors, glass breakage detectors, a monitored smoke alarm, and screamers. The electrics are protected by twin earth leakage detectors and circuit breakers and there are two smoke alarms. For additional security, there is a camera intercom on the front door. Hot water is provided by solar.There is a long verandah along the front and side of the home from which to enjoy the views. The rear garden has an enclosed recycled brick courtyard area that would be ideal for entertaining and for those hot Perth summer days, a concrete, below ground salt-water swimming pool overlooking the city (the sand filter, pump, self-cleaning chlorinator cell, and controller have been replaced). There is plenty of parking on this property, the front has a large parking area and behind the house there is a double garage (brick/iron). For those that would like a huge workshop, there is plenty of room to erect one with vehicle access to the rear of the property.For the garden lovers, there is a well-established “old fashioned” garden with lots of trees. There are a number of perfumed plants including jasmine, honeysuckle, etc. There are plenty of fruit trees including weeping mulberry, loquat, plum, pomegranate, avocado, lemon, and tangelo. There are also a number of roses. Lots of native birds are also present including kookaburras, galahs, 28s, new Holland honey eaters, magpies, and greeneyes to name a few.A bore has been drilled that according to the driller's estimation can produce 50 tonnes (50,000 litres) of crystal clear water per day. The driller measured the water at 20 ppm salt which is very pure (rainwater is 10 ppm salt).The views over Perth are spectacular at night – highly recommended to inspect this property in the evening as well as the day. The location and aspect of this home is ideally suited for a future double storey addition – enclosing the pool and over the top of the formal lounge would be a stunning addition. This ½ acre property is located 25 minutes from the city and is only 20 minutes from the airport – ideal for fly in/fly out.Move in and enjoy the Hills lifestyle.","468","562"

"174801","full_desc","Are you looking for a low maintenance rural weekender that has easy 2WD access & comfortable living accommodation? Would you like a lovely sunny aspect with great views, creek frontage and plenty of open area for possibly a horse or two? Preferably with little or nothing more needed to spend to relax and enjoy your time away? Congratulations – you have just found it! With direct access off Upper Yango Creek Rd, only 5kms from the main road, this property features a large, modern colourbond shed that has been transformed into a very comfortable and attractive weekender. Glass sliding doors open onto a 50 sq metre decking and paved area that is bordered by a bushrock garden bed with low maintenance native plants and lovely views over the valley floor. Many properties in the Wollombi area have limited sunlight due to the narrow valleys, but this property captures the first rays of early morning sun right through to the last stages of sunset - a beautiful time to be sitting outside. The walls and pitched ceiling are fully insulated and timber lined which creates an attractive and functional interior. You have a large kitchen with a gas cooktop and electric double wall oven, and plenty of cupboard space and bench tops. Two bedrooms are to the sides of the kitchen and one has built in storage and shelving. The front two thirds provides for a spacious open plan living area. A charming copper plated combustion fireplace sits to one side and provides warmth to the whole building. A dining area in the middle separates this from a lounge area on the other side with satellite Foxtel enabled. Telephone and internet services are also there, which makes it very easy to stay an extra couple of days if you are able to work from home! A rustic, matching building hosts a full bathroom and laundry, with mini orb and timber lined walls and hardwood flooring. A caravan and annexe with a timber floor is situated under a double carport and provides comfortable additional accommodation for the extra family and friends who will no doubt be regular visitors! There is a very large chook yard and house, with automated feeder and water that lasts from one weekend through to the next, so always plenty of farm fresh eggs! A shed for the ride on mower and tools as well as feed bins and extra storage is next to this, and catches water in a tank for the horses. A creek is a truly wonderful feature on a property, and if you walk (or drive) right through the block to the rear there is a beautiful cleared paddock that runs along a picturesque section of creek and is a great spot for secluded picnics or camping around a big winter bonfire.","537","629"

"164023","full_desc","The property is situated at Curra approximately 20klms north of Gympie. Gympie is a historical gold mining town 167 klms North of Brisbane, a short 67 klms south to beautiful Noosa, 74 klms east to Rainbow Beach and 120 klms north to Hervey Bay. There are plenty of additional choices for your enjoyment. The house sits on a beautiful tree covered 20000 sq metre (5 acre) allotment. The three bedroom home (two with built-ins), has been recently renovated and is in a move in, sit back and relax condition. The open plan kitchen, living and dining area also boasts an air conditioner and for those chilly country winter nights a combustion wood fired heater. No need to worry about those high electricity costs in this home because you are cooking with gas and at the end of your day relax with a soothing hot shower or bath, compliments of a gas hot water system. A spare toilet for those extra visitors. Enjoy the softness of the rainwater drawn from three 5000 gallon tanks. Sit back in the afternoon and enjoy some refreshments on the rear covered paved area, plenty of room here, under the 6 metre x 13 metre covered area and great for the kids in rainy weather. Watch the kangaroos laze about in the back yard. As you drive in the hardstand circular driveway, you notice the landscaped gardens and the peaceful pergola area at the front of the house. Put your car in the single garage or the 6 metre x 6 metre steel shed. Tend to your plants in the fernery and your home grown food in the large semi covered and reticulated vegetable garden. Pick those citrus fruits, bananas and macadamia nuts in the right season. As an added bonus there is council approval to sub-divide the property with all the survey work completed. The approved rear block is 12000 sq metres (3 acres) gently sloping to the dam, with a 110 metre access attached to the block (no easement here). Minor work is required to complete the sub-division. Keep the property as one, build another house for your family or treat the rear block as extra superannuation for the future. This home presents itself in peaceful surrounds and in a manner that allows you to relax, with the further opportunity to reap the rewards from the rear block at a later date. Comfort, peace and security, what more could you want. Opportunity presents itself.","624","713"

This is a very unique house and property with it's own powerful identity. It was designed and has been entirely crafted by hand from the finest natural materials available by a craftsman cabinetmaker and myself to create a home that will challenge you to think beyond your dreams.
The surrounding rainforest and gardens have evolved into a sanctuary for wildlife and native birds especially the Black Cockatoos (Kearra is Aboriginal for cockatoo). The environment that has been created at “Kearra Gardens” is one of quiet solitude that gives you the opportunity to relax and think.
“A grand design built by traditional crafts persons”……… Martin Rubenstein

The other side of the property has been undergoing a renovation to remove the ugly and make it livable again , by the owner , so is currently still got some bits and bobs kicking around from that reno.
ZONED R100. This allows for a 5 story mixed residential /commercial property to be developed at your leisure.
This is a great property located in a great spot to capitalize on future devolopments in Mandurah
Why buy this property over another similar property?
That is simple $$$ With two units there will be two income streams , so rather than get $250 PW for one, your return is $450 P/W. This makes buying and holding this property the easiest thing to do , New photos uploaded sorry it looks dirty been busy packing up my worldly posessions photos are of unit 1 .","796","888"

It will be rented out again if not sold in 30 days. Current rental price is 350 per week approx. It is a great rental as it is positioned within a minutes walk to Cannonvale's major shopping center, great pub, restaurant, public transport. 5 minutes walk to beautiful beach and park, short public transport to Airlie beach with all the attractions Airlie has, boat cruises, Hamilton, Daydream, south mole islands. National parks etc. Would be a great retirement or first home. No work to do and a lovely quite area with no neighbors on one side and great people on the other side, the rear neighbors are a long way away due to the long yard.","803","895"

Whilst being the administrative centre of the Douglas Shire, Mossman is overshadowed in size and by reputation by the coastal village of Port Douglas, 20 kilometres south of Mossman. Sharing the same latitude as Tahiti, and just 70 kilometres (or a scenic one-hour drive north of Cairns), lies Port Douglas. Stunningly located on famous Four-Mile Beach, this formerly sleepy fishing village is a secluded tropical paradise nestled between tropical World Heritage Rainforest and the Great Barrier Reef. Port Douglas is renowned for its great range of award-winning restaurants and attractive tree-lined streets bordered with galleries, boutiques and sidewalk cafes.
Easily accessible by car, bus, coach, limousine, boat and helicopter, Port Douglas is the gateway to the Great Barrier Reef and the World Heritage Daintree Rainforest. Port Douglas has long been a popular destination for the well-heeled tourist, with a number of quality resorts such as the Sheraton Mirage, Peppers Links Resort, Radisson Treetops Resort, Outrigger Port Douglas and Rydges Reef Resort. More have just recently been constructed such as Bale’, Juniper’s Sea Temple Resort, and Lagoons @ Port. Sheraton Mirage was recently purchased by a Chinese investor for new renovations. This recent activity along with many of the other attractions of Port Douglas make the property I'm selling very attractive and could potentially be an investors great opportunity to develop a unique business venture. Port Douglas has a number of world-class golf courses and the water temperature is warm enough to swim all year round. Its many attractions include fishing, diving, sailing, white-water rafting, four-wheel driving, horse-riding and even just lazing in the sun. Hidden in the Whyanbeel Valley are a number of executive retreats (villas) set amidst rainforest acres that offer exclusive and luxurious private holiday accommodation.
The land presents a number of development opportunities :
* Potential for a wide range of commercial, tourist and/or residential uses;
*Can appeal to a wide range of markets, e.g. the eco-tourism market
* Lessees of cash crops incur the responsibility for, and costs of, land clearing;
This is very unique rainforest land and I'm willing to negotiate a good price for an interested buyer. I'm available to show the property in more detail at anytime.","847","932"

"230476","full_desc","This is a Yeronga river front unit. You will be living by Brisbane River enjoying Kayaking, Fishing and walking or walking your dog on Brisbane Corso. It feels like the weekend every day. Quite peaceful area, you will sleep and wakeup on the sound of nature, lots of Kookaburras and birds. The air flow from the sea up the river is clean and refreshing.
The unit is part of 6 identical units in the complex they have the same size and internal design, refer to the diagram in the photos. One of the units was sold last month for $330,000. This is a solid investment; my last Brisbane City Council rates show a unit land valuation of $267,000 and it is increasing. Unit 1,2,4&6 are owner occupiers. Unit 3&5 are rented for $300 a week, that is“ $15,600 a year for each unit from renting income The interest rate for a $270,000 based on %3.5 is $9450 a year. The complex has over $50,000 in sinking fund available for renovation. If this place is ever rebuilt or renovated the potential for doubling your investment exist.
The spacious 1brm apartment and large lounge separated by mezzanine floor for privacy is ideal for singles or couples who are looking for something more than an everyday unit. You can move straight in and enjoy. A must to inspect, you will really enjoy this one. Private, close to the University of Queensland, the local cafes, restaurants and shops are all within minutes of home.

When it is time to retreat to enjoy a quite read or to watch a movie there is a media room / formal lounge. Four very large bedrooms all feature built-in robes, ceiling fans and large windows.
There is even somewhere comfortable for all of your favourite toys to rest in the detached double lockup garage.
The garage features a bathroom, double carport and a workshop that has copious bench space and shelving. Constructed by a craftsman builder, this seven year old home had no expense spared in the quest for long lasting, hassle free, peace of mind.

This is a unique family dwelling or holiday home, on a corner block, presented as two adjacent, but independent, houses.
It is ideal for accommodating extended families, two families, or you and your guests in separate, self-contained houses.
You could live in one and rent out the other to offset your mortgage. Each house could achieve $200+ per week in long-term rental income or $100+ per night as an Airbnb.
Situated on a sheltered block in a quiet street, this property combines privacy with river views.
House 1 has three bedrooms - two large and one small, an air-conditioned lounge and a large kitchen / family room with original timber floors.
House 2 has one bedroom and an open-plan kitchen / dining / family room. The kitchen was upgraded five years ago with new cupboards and appliances, and the whole area has low-maintenance beech floating floors. A split system air-conditioner heats and cools the house. As an added bonus, this house is fully-furnished: ready for you to move in and enjoy.
A large deck links the two houses and overlooks the attractive, easily-maintained garden with peach and apple trees. One end of the deck leads to a private, enclosed 6m x 1.2m pool, making it a perfect area for outdoor living.
Extra desirable features include a large, 3-bay shed, 2 rainwater tanks in addition to mains-water connection, solar panels and enough off-street parking for a caravan, a boat and 6 cars. Both houses are connected to the local fixed-wireless NBN network with download speeds in excess of 30Mbps.
This property is located just an hour from the city of Adelaide via Strathalbyn, Mount Barker and the freeway. Alternatively, it is an easy hour’s drive on the Southern expressway via McLaren Vale, Mount Compass and Finniss. Close to the picturesque wineries of Langhorne Creek, approximately fifteen kilometres upriver from Goolwa and a similar distance downstream from Milang on the banks of the River Murray, it is an ideal base from which to explore the many attractions of the Fleurieu Peninsula.
Relax on the elevated deck with a glass of Bremerton Sauvignon Blanc and gaze at the yachts drifting across Clayton Bay in the late afternoon sunshine. The sounds of honey-eaters, swifts and whistling kites provide a gentle musical background as pelicans glide gracefully overhead. On the barbecue, locally caught Coorong mullet sizzles to golden perfection as the family gathers at the outdoor dining table for a delightful dinner as the sun sets and the stars of the magnificent Milky Way begin to blaze across the night sky.
13, Rankine Street is all about lifestyle and the living here is easy. Spend weekends and holidays in complete relaxation or retire to a tiny, but active, small town community. At the recent KESAB awards, the Clayton Bay Community Association was awarded the 2016 Outstanding Community Event for their Waterways Event. The Clayton Bay Nursery & Environmental Group received the 2016 Natural Environment Award in recognition of outstanding work in the revegetation, maintenance and enhancement of the Clayton Bay environment and Clayton Bay also won the Best Small Town award.","887","969"

Entry to this split level home is into a 2 storey vestibule which leads down into a large living area with a wall of louvers for unparalleled breeze and light.

A large double bedroom recently built meeting all local council approvals is a perfect compliment to extending this home to 4 bedrooms.

Once you have climbed the timber staircase, level 2 will astound you. Large, open plan living with louvers for all day breezes and natural light, not to mention the stunning views – Cape Cleveland to the city, who could ask for more? The combined living / dining leads to a raised floor kitchen with stainless appliances (dishwasher, wall oven and cook top), pantry and cupboard space for maximum storage and microwave and fridge recess. The fridge can remain with the house if you wish. The main bedroom sits on this level also, and enjoys the same breezes, natural lights and views. The room is an excellent size and carries its own study, ensuite and separate toilet. Both ensuite and bedroom include built ins.
Walk out of the double timber doors of either the main bedroom or the living and you will find the jewel within this beautiful crown. A covered timber deck, high over neighbouring properties. The views, tranquillity, privacy, and the breeze. Why would you want to leave? It even has its own built in BBQ nook with range hood and fridge space.
The home itself sits on 780 m2 high in Wulguru Heights and is constructed of rendered blockwork and cedar cladding, You will be pleased to know that the cedar has recently been resealed offering many maintenance free years ahead. The grounds are fully irrigated with colourful lush plantings, and there is plenty of storage, or for the handy man, workshop space under the house.
This property is a must to inspect. You will not be disappointed.","912","993"

"257293","full_desc","This tastefully renovated 3 bedroom brick veneer cottage with uninterrupted views to the North-West's iconic Mount Roland is for sale! Situated in West Kentish, this 1600 m2 plot is sandwiched between pastoral grazing land providing optimum peace and quiet and privacy.
The house welcomes you with a brand new concrete patio at the front of the home. The entry opens to the hall area leading to living spaces, bedrooms and bathroom. With a north-western aspect for the sunny lounge, it is comfortable at all times of year between the natural sunlight and a wood fire for those chilly Tasmanian nights. The lounge is semi open plan which leads into the sunny kitchen area, which has been recently renovated. It has a large pantry, perfect for all your food storage.
Down the hall, the two main bedrooms capture the afternoon sunlight on the western side. Both rooms feature built in robes with plenty of storage space. To the end of the hall is the bathroom which has also been newly renovated, a bright, white space with bath and a separate shower.
The laundry and WC are situated in the middle of the home with an additional room to the back of the house. This could easily be used as a third bedroom but we use it as a music room. This room opens to the back porch.
To the rear of the house off the back porch area is an additional storage room which is perfect for all the odds and ends and camping equipment you may have. It also holds unlocked potential for renovation as it would have perfect views of Mount Roland.
The gardens are easily maintained with most being grassed area. There is a fenced off vegetable garden in the back yard in which we have grown so much delicious produce. There is a chicken coop for your own feathered friends to lay your morning eggs.
There is also a single garage and a garden shed as well as approx 35,000 litre in total of water storage.
This property is situated an easy 5 minute drive from the township of Sheffield which has a kindergarten to grade 10 public school, and the property is a pleasant 30 minutes commute to Devonport.","933","1013"

This property will not last long
At number 98 Atlantic Drive Loganholme there is only one word that can be used
POTENTIAL !!


This property has everything that will appeal to all buyers
DEVELOPERS
it sits on 1879m2 of prime development land
It is in the heart of the new Loganholme Neighbourhood Plan which was recently rezoned
it allows for Townhouses to be built here ..(max 2 levels 21-40 dw/ha) STCA
INVESTORS
This property has a 3 bedroom house PLUS 2 stand alone powered sheds ..1 of which has been converted into a 2 bedroom 1 bathroom self contained Granny flat.
It is currently being used for storage but with a bit of TLC and STCA it will easily be rented out
With the main 3 bedroom house ($400 ) and the potential 2 bedroom granny flat ($300 ) rent expected would be $700 per week

LARGE FAMILIES
For those looking for a property where a large family could live..look no further
Tidy up the converted shed and use it as a teenagers pad ,granny flat or even rent out for extra income (STCA)

HOME BASED BUSINESS
Instead of using the converted shed for living, why not turn it into a home office (STCA)
Plenty of room with its own facilities with power ,water internet and foxtel all installed

Other features of this amazing property are
A huge deck..approx 40m2 for entertaining or extended living
A pond plus waterfall..needs TLC but an amazing feature
A massive shed with power and car hoist..15mts x 6mts with high ceiling..perfect for storage
Great gardens with fruit trees such as bananas, mango,mulberries,mandarin and passion fruit
Loads of room for chickens and vegetables gardens
Fully secured with lockable gates

This property has the potential to be one of the best decisions you have ever made
It needs some work and some TLC but the rewards are worth it

This property is just off the Pacific Highway,
The area has
Schools,priavte and public
Many gyms,
3 major shopping centres.(Hyperdome and Woolworths and Foodworks 24hr shops)
Great public transport..bus terminal at the Hyperdome...bus routes along Bryants Rd
Family Park
Many takeaway options
Doctors
Medical Specialists
Dentists
Chemists
Vet

The area is centrally located between Brisbane,Gold Coast,Ipswich and Cleveland
with the Logan Motorway less than 5 minutes away ..nothing is far from Loganholme

Which is one of the reasons that the Logan City Council decided to rezone the area as they know that an area like this is almost impossible to find
A quick Google search will show you that this area is about to become one of ,not just Queenslands but ,Australias real estate hotspots
Currently there are talks to revamp the area just south of here into an International Tourism Precinct with proposals to turn the stretch of the Logan River into a SouthBank style of development.. STCA
There has been talk that major retailers, such as Costco have looked into this area...nothing certain as yet but with the limited spare land along the highway, something big will be happening here soon

DONT MISS OUT
A quick drive along Atlantic Drive Loganholme will prove that this area is going ahead extremely quickly..

MAKE A PHONE CALL TODAY..DONT DELAY
THIS WILL NOT LAST...

Four spacious bedrooms (three up and one down) are complimented by a well appointed timber kitchen featuring stainless steel appliances, a new dishwasher and ample pantry. The adjoining family room and breakfast bar area complete the hub of this well presented family home providing a relaxing environment to enjoy family dinners together or simply watch a movie. For more formal occasions the semi enclosed separate dining room is ideal for entertaining in style. This room could easily double as a study if preferred or even a fifth bedroom if the need arises.
Beautiful big wide wrap around verandas overlooking the park provides a relaxing environment to just sit back, taking in the views with an all year round blissful breeze.
The spacious downstairs bedroom makes for a great teenagers retreat or perhaps a practical bedroom for aged relatives who struggle with stairs. And during the long hot summer months you can cool off in the privacy of your own in ground salt water pool adjoining the downstairs rumpus room with a wet bar.
A bonus downstairs covered entertaining area doubles as an ideal spot for hosting parties or providing protection for your boat,caravan or additional cars. Quite a package! The property is currently tenanted & is a great investment opportunity! Arrange for an inspection.

The lounge room has that cosy feel with a slow combustion wood fire and brick feature wall. The rumpus room has a nice outlook through the large 4m wide glass sliding doors which open onto the verandah. The family room is large, with a dining area at one end opposite the kitchen, and a study area at the other. The kitchen has been recently renovated and has a pantry, dishwasher and breakfast bar. All the living areas, dining and kitchen are tiled, plus there&rsquo;s a reverse cycle air conditioner in the kitchen and a ceiling fan in the lounge room. There are 4 good sized bedrooms, two with built-in wardrobes. The three way bathroom upstairs has also been recently renovated and has a stylish polyurethane vanity and separate toilet.<br /><br />&nbsp;Downstairs is an oversized (1 &frac34; size) single garage which has been converted into a music studio. So, whether you need a spot for the car or the drum kit &ndash; this house delivers. The studio walls are easily removed and converted back to a garage. But, if you&rsquo;re a professional muso, garage rock band or karaoke queen this studio could be your heart&rsquo;s desire. With acoustic bats and gyprock, it&rsquo;s 70% sound proofed, so you could belt out a song or two at 2am and the neighbours will never know. Apart from the studio, there is a mixing room, lounge area, toilet and separate shower.<br /><br />&nbsp;Outside, the house features a sunny courtyard off the dining area plus a good sized yard. The house sits on a large corner block, and has gates and side access on both sides of the house, plus a new garden shed. The front yard has been landscaped and is low maintenance.&nbsp;<br /><br />Houses of this size and quality are hard to find in this price bracket. Definitely one to take a look at during an Open For Inspection, or arrange a personal inspection today. </p><p align=""left"">For further details please phone 0418 148 194 </p>","22","1"

It&rsquo;s a simple business to run, and it will give you a great start in the small business bull ring.

Judging by the amount of requests we get for our services, that demand has only grown.</font></p><p><font size=""2"">There is the added bonus of having the successful and trustworthy name of VIP behind you. Franchisee support is excellent, with area meetings tri-monthly. The VIP head office does all the major advertising, with all enquiries going through the central call centre, then on to you via SMS. It&rsquo;s convenient - and it works.</font></p><p><font size=""2"">We have a solid, regular customer base which will be included in the sale, as is all equipment. You will also receive 4 weeks training before starting. </font></p><p><font size=""2"">For more information contact:</font></p><p><font size=""2"">Nick or Beth on 0408 233 459</font></p><p><font size=""2"">E-mail:&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><a href=""mailto:weathered.stone@internode.on.net""><font size=""2"">weathered.stone@internode.on.net</font></a></p></div>","32","1"

Does a self sufficient eco friendly life sound appealing?<br /><br />We have the perfect lifestyle property that will change the way you live for the better. This 3 bedroom home is built on 13 acres and is situated on beautiful historic Norfolk Island on the edge of the National Park and will never be built out. <br /><br />Forget the electricity bills &ndash; you&rsquo;ll never receive one living in this eco friendly house. The house is operated solely on solar electricity. But don&rsquo;t worry, you still have all the modern cons including dishwasher, gas stove, front loading washing machine and upright fridge and freezer. The 3 bedroom house has an open plan living area plus a pool room or family room. <br /><br />The kitchen is made from locally produced Norfolk Pine and has stainless steel 2 draw dishwasher, stainless steel gas stove, large pantry and island bench. The house comes fully furnished due to the expense of shipping furniture to and from the island. You name it, it&rsquo;s included right down to the crockery and cutlery. All you&rsquo;ll need is your clothes! The house also has a combustion fire, solar hot water and is set up and ready for Pay TV.<br /><br />The property is classed as freehold and includes 2 water tanks, a veggie patch, tractor and 2 cows. Norfolk Island is only 2 hours from Australia in the South Pacific Ocean. The island lies on the Norfolk Ridge which runs from New Zealand to New Caledonia. <br /><br />It lies 500 miles SSE of Noumea, 700 miles NW of Auckland, 900 miles east of Brisbane and 1100 miles NE of Sydney. It has a subtropical climate with an average rainfall of 1328mm per year. Lovely summer days range from 24 - 28.4 degrees. Mid-winter temperatures range from 19 - 21 degrees during the day.<br /><br />The current owners set up the property so that they could be fully self sufficient and it is with regret that they are placing the property on the market. This is a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique ECO friendly property on Norfolk Island with loads of potential. Priced at $610,000 For further details please phone 02 4256 0689","118","214"

"319973","full_desc","<p>Brand new 25 year lease has been created for this growing business, however the owners will consider offers for the freehold.. The caravan park has been successfully run by a couple for the last 8 years and during this time the turnover has grown from $76,000 to (projected for 2012 year) $300,000. The excellent location just off the highway and close to the clubs and shops makes it a very popular stopping point for the thousands of travelers moving north and south each year. The cabin business has a steady income from traveler&rsquo;s and local miners, (the new Tomingley gold mine is starting just 15K up the road) and boosted by events like the Elvis festival in Parkes. A unique tourist attraction 'The Big Fish Fossil Hut' has recently been added to the park. Extra land has been purchased for an extension to the park to cater for the growing number of 'gray nomads' who are finding it more and more difficult and expensive to stop in parks along the coast. Currently the park is licensed for 34 sites however the additional land will enable it to go to around 50 sites.<br /><br /><br /><br />The convenient store located in the office area of the caravan park is now established as a very popular shop for the local Peak Hill community. The operators residence is a 2 bedroom house attached to the shop/office for easy access during open hours.<br /><br />The park has many other features that make it very popular with the traveling public, interested persons please contact the owner for further details.</p>","455","550"

<p>Derby is now recognised as one of the best Mountain Bike destinations in the world.</p>
<p>The once sleepy township is struggling to keep up with the demand for accommodation and this demand is set to continue as the number of tracks in planning and construction are completed.</p>
<p>Derby is currently the fastest growing tourist hotspot in Tasmania.</p>
<p>This generously proportioned block of 1920 sq metres is located adjacent to the Tasman Highway, the only road in and out of Derby.</p>
<p>The block is flat to gently sloping with rich well drained soil unlike most of Derby which is built on exposed rock and is expensive or unviable to build on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The block has approx 2 Ha of Crown land on either side which could be leased now or in the future at a small annual fee.</p>
<p>Behind the block is a vast area of native forest with majestic Eucylpts, towering manferns and massive granite outcrops.</p>
<p>5 minutes walk eastward &nbsp;leads to Valley Ponds, a 5ha lake and wetlands area teaming with platypus ideal for canoeing and swimming.</p>
<p>The Ringarooma River, home to the annual Derby River Derby , is a 5 minute walk to the north.</p>
<p>The block is just 3 minutes drive to the central hub of Derby, offering a convenient escape from the crowds.</p>
<p>This would make an excellent block for Eco pods.</p>
<p>The Zoning is Rural Resources which encourages Tourist Accommodation.</p>
<p>Be quick as Derby properties are selling fast.</p>","1100","1067"

The majority of the property is on a hillside, including a shack which was formerly used as a residence, and the old walking track to the Daintree village. The property would be ideal for an adventurous family or an eco- resort. The property is approximately 29 ha (71.66 acres)</p>
<p>There are two structures on the property , one can be used as a shed and the other provides a good foundation to build a house or basic dwelling. There is electricity and access to water. <br />&acirc;&euro;&uml;<br />Some great features of the property:</p>
<p>*Located in the tourist mecca of tropical north Queensland and near well-known destinations as Port Douglas and Mossman Gorge<br />*Seclusion <br />*Freehold title; <br />*Natural topography provides height and aspect<br />*This property is one of the largest northern-most freehold land parcels that can be developed in Queensland.</p>
<p>Mossman is the nearest town to this property located in the Whyanbeel Valley, its approximately a 10-15 minute drive.<br />The town of Mossman is located 75 kilometres north of Cairns. The first sugar cane was grown near Mossman in 1896 and the Mossman sugar mill &ndash; the most northerly in Queensland &ndash; was opened the following year. Apart from the sugar industry, the surrounding district also raises cattle and produces a wide variety of tropical fruits. A short distance from Mossman is the beautiful Mossman Gorge and there are a number of Bed and Breakfast (B&amp;B) establishments servicing the holiday market, as well as the well-known Voyages Silky Oaks Lodge and Healing Waters Spa, some seven kilometres north-west of Mossman itself, which offers luxury accommodation in a rainforest setting. Also in Mossman itself is The White Cockatoo, the premier nudist resort in far north Queensland which offers 3&frac12; star accommodation. .3 hectares in size and is located at the very end of Whyanbeel Road.<br />Whilst being the administrative centre of the Douglas Shire, Mossman is overshadowed in size and by reputation by the coastal village of Port Douglas, 20 kilometres south of Mossman. Sharing the same latitude as Tahiti, and just 70 kilometres (or a scenic one-hour drive north of Cairns), lies Port Douglas. Stunningly located on famous Four-Mile Beach, this formerly sleepy fishing village is a secluded tropical paradise nestled between tropical World Heritage Rainforest and the Great Barrier Reef. Port Douglas is renowned for its great range of award-winning restaurants and attractive tree-lined streets bordered with galleries, boutiques and sidewalk cafes. <br />Easily accessible by car, bus, coach, limousine, boat and helicopter, Port Douglas is the gateway to the Great Barrier Reef and the World Heritage Daintree Rainforest. Port Douglas has long been a popular destination for the well-heeled tourist, with a number of quality resorts such as the Sheraton Mirage, Peppers Links Resort, Radisson Treetops Resort, Outrigger Port Douglas and Rydges Reef Resort. More have just recently been constructed such as Bale&rsquo;, Juniper&rsquo;s Sea Temple Resort, and Lagoons @ Port. Sheraton Mirage was recently purchased by a Chinese investor for new renovations. This recent activity along with many of the other attractions of Port Douglas make the property I'm selling very attractive and could potentially be an investors great opportunity to develop a unique business venture. Port Douglas has a number of world-class golf courses and the water temperature is warm enough to swim all year round. Its many attractions include fishing, diving, sailing, white-water rafting, four-wheel driving, horse-riding and even just lazing in the sun. Hidden in the Whyanbeel Valley are a number of executive retreats (villas) set amidst rainforest acres that offer exclusive and luxurious private holiday accommodation.</p>
<p>The land presents a number of development opportunities :<br />* Potential for a wide range of commercial, tourist and/or residential uses;<br />*Can appeal to a wide range of markets, e.g. the eco-tourism market<br />* Lessees of cash crops incur the responsibility for, and costs of, land clearing;</p>
<p>This is very unique rainforest land and I'm willing to negotiate a good price for an interested buyer. I'm available to show the property in more detail at anytime.</p>","847","932"

"230476","full_desc","<p>This is a Yeronga river front unit. You will be living by Brisbane River enjoying Kayaking, Fishing and walking or walking your dog on Brisbane Corso. It feels like the weekend every day. Quite peaceful area, you will sleep and wakeup on the sound of nature, lots of Kookaburras and birds. The air flow from the sea up the river is clean and refreshing. <br /> <br /> The unit is part of 6 identical units in the complex they have the same size and internal design, refer to the diagram in the photos. One of the units was sold last month for $330,000. This is a solid investment; my last Brisbane City Council rates show a unit land valuation of $267,000 and it is increasing. Unit 1,2,4&amp;6 are owner occupiers. Unit 3&amp;5 are rented for $300 a week, that is&ldquo; $15,600 a year for each unit from renting income The interest rate for a $270,000 based on %3.5 is $9450 a year. &nbsp;The complex has over $50,000 in sinking fund available for renovation. If this place is ever rebuilt or renovated the potential for doubling your investment exist. <br /> <br /> The spacious 1brm apartment and large lounge separated by mezzanine floor for privacy is ideal for singles or couples who are looking for something more than an everyday unit. You can move straight in and enjoy. A must to inspect, you will really enjoy this one. Private, close to the University of Queensland, the local cafes, restaurants and shops are all within minutes of home.</p>

<p>This is a unique family dwelling or holiday home, on a corner block, presented as two adjacent, but independent, houses.</p>
<p>It is ideal for accommodating extended families, two families, or you and your guests in separate, self-contained houses.</p>
<p>You could live in one and rent out the other to offset your mortgage. Each house could achieve $200+ per week in long-term rental income or $100+ per night as an Airbnb.</p>
<p>Situated on a sheltered block in a quiet street, this property combines privacy with river views.</p>
<p>House 1 has three bedrooms - two large and one small, an air-conditioned lounge and a large kitchen / family room with original timber floors.</p>
<p>House 2 has one bedroom and an open-plan kitchen / dining / family room. The kitchen was upgraded five years ago with new cupboards and appliances, and the whole area has low-maintenance beech floating floors. A split system air-conditioner heats and cools the house. As an added bonus, this house is&nbsp;fully-furnished: ready for you to move in and enjoy.</p>
<p>A large deck links the two houses and overlooks the attractive, easily-maintained garden with peach and apple&nbsp;trees. One end of the deck leads to a private, enclosed 6m x 1.2m pool, making it a perfect area for outdoor living.</p>
<p>Extra desirable features include a large, 3-bay shed, 2 rainwater tanks in addition to mains-water connection, solar panels and enough off-street parking for a caravan, a boat and 6 cars. Both houses are connected to the local fixed-wireless NBN network with download speeds in excess of 30Mbps.</p>
<p>This property is located just an hour from the city of Adelaide via Strathalbyn, Mount Barker and the freeway. Alternatively, it is an easy hour&rsquo;s drive on the Southern expressway via McLaren Vale, Mount Compass and Finniss. Close to the picturesque wineries of Langhorne Creek, approximately fifteen kilometres upriver from Goolwa and a similar distance downstream from Milang on the banks of the River Murray, it is an ideal base from which to explore the many attractions of the Fleurieu Peninsula.</p>
<p>Relax on the elevated deck with a glass of Bremerton Sauvignon Blanc and gaze at the yachts drifting across Clayton Bay in the late afternoon sunshine. The sounds of honey-eaters, swifts and whistling kites provide a gentle musical background as pelicans glide gracefully overhead.&nbsp;On the barbecue, locally caught Coorong mullet sizzles to golden perfection as the family gathers at the outdoor dining table for a delightful dinner as the sun sets and the stars of the magnificent Milky Way begin to blaze across the night sky.</p>
<p>13, Rankine Street is all about lifestyle and the living here is easy. Spend weekends and&nbsp;holidays in complete relaxation or retire to a tiny, but active, small town community. At the recent KESAB awards, the Clayton Bay Community Association was awarded the 2016 Outstanding Community Event for their Waterways Event. The Clayton Bay Nursery &amp;&nbsp;Environmental Group received the 2016 Natural Environment Award in recognition of outstanding work in the revegetation, maintenance and enhancement of the Clayton Bay environment and Clayton Bay also won the Best Small Town award.</p>","887","969"

<p>Entry to this split level home is into a 2 storey vestibule which leads down into a large living area with a wall of louvers for unparalleled breeze and light. A private timber deck can be accessed from two bedrooms with built ins. A large double bedroom recently built meeting all local council approvals is a perfect compliment to extending this home to 4 bedrooms. Level 1 also offers substantial storage space, a modern bathroom with separate toilet, a laundry with room to move and a double garage with remote doors.</p>
<p>Once you have climbed the timber staircase, level 2 will astound you. Large, open plan living with louvers for all day breezes and natural light, not to mention the stunning views &ndash; Cape Cleveland to the city, who could ask for more? The combined living / dining leads to a raised floor kitchen with stainless appliances (dishwasher, wall oven and cook top), pantry and cupboard space for maximum storage and microwave and fridge recess. The fridge can remain with the house if you wish. The main bedroom sits on this level also, and enjoys the same breezes, natural lights and views. The room is an excellent size and carries its own study, ensuite and separate toilet. Both ensuite and bedroom include built ins.</p>
<p>Walk out of the double timber doors of either the main bedroom or the living and you will find the jewel within this beautiful crown. A covered timber deck, high over neighbouring properties. The views, tranquillity, privacy, and the breeze. Why would you want to leave? It even has its own built in BBQ nook with range hood and fridge space.</p>
<p>The home itself sits on 780 m2 high in Wulguru Heights and is constructed of rendered blockwork and cedar cladding, You will be pleased to know that the cedar has recently been resealed offering many maintenance free years ahead. The grounds are fully irrigated with colourful lush plantings, and there is plenty of storage, or for the handy man, workshop space under the house.</p>
<p>This property is a must to inspect. You will not be disappointed.</p>","912","993"

"289857","full_desc","<p>This large home with renovated kitchen and bathroom backs onto a beautiful park in the nicest area of Harristown. This home has lovely vistas from each window, is cool in summer and warm in winter. You will hardly need to light the wood heater. It has plenty of rooms and spaces to raise your family and you have the park for the kids to fly a kite, play cricket or football. You really won't find another like it and there is only one neighbour. What more could you want? Loved by first family for over 60 years. The much loved gardens with flower, fruit and vegetable now need a little TLC to bring them back to their glory.</p>
<p>This home has a formal dining and lounge rooms, 4 Bedrooms, two with built ins. The fourth bedroom is very large and has been used as both a bedroom and family room over the years. The home also has an additional large room that has been used as both a workshop and storage room. With little effort this room has the great potential for many things such as an additional 5 bedroom, family room, or halve it and keep the workshop and have a small 5th bedroom. You could also open up this room to the 4th bedroom and then create a self sufficient flat, student accommodation or B&amp;B for extra income since both rooms have their own individual access doors. Alternatively, why not turn the extra large 4th bedroom into a teenager&rsquo;s retreat or grandparent&rsquo;s room and keep the large workshop area for mum or dad or both. This home has a lot of potential to make changes to suit your own living space needs and desires at a minimal cost of time and money.</p>
<p>The home also has a fenced, private backyard with a great entertaining deck overlooking gardens and parkland. Secure carport at the front with side access to the backyard. Backyard has the potential for many things even for a two bay shed and it comes with large water tank and garden shed.</p>
<p>With walking distances&nbsp;to all Harristown Schools and close to a Bus stop at the end of the street, you can keep the car at home. Close to the Base Hospital.</p>
<p>Only 5 mins to the city, the University, all major Toowoomba Shopping Centres, the iconic Japanese Gardens and Laurel Bank Park. A Catholic Church is 50 metres away and within a few minutes walk, there is an Anglican Church. Position, Position, Position!</p>","1087","1147"

<p>This property will not last long</p>
<p>At number 98 Atlantic Drive Loganholme there is only one word that can be used</p>
<p>POTENTIAL !!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This property has everything that will appeal to all buyers</p>
<p>DEVELOPERS</p>
<p>it sits on 1879m2 of prime development land</p>

<p>INVESTORS</p>
<p>This property has a 3 bedroom house PLUS&nbsp;2&nbsp;stand alone &nbsp;powered sheds ..1 of which has been converted into a 2 bedroom 1 bathroom self contained Granny flat.</p>
<p>It is currently being used for storage but with a bit of TLC and STCA it will easily be rented out</p>
<p>With the main 3 bedroom house ($400 ) and the potential 2 bedroom granny flat ($300 ) rent expected would be $700 per week</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>LARGE FAMILIES</p>
<p>For those looking for a property where a large family could live..look no further</p>
<p>Tidy up the converted shed and use it as a teenagers pad ,granny flat or even rent out for extra income (STCA)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HOME BASED BUSINESS</p>
<p>Instead of using the converted shed for living, why not turn it into a home office (STCA)</p>
<p>Plenty of room with its own facilities with power ,water internet and foxtel all installed</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other features of this amazing property are</p>
<p>A huge deck..approx 40m2 for entertaining or extended living</p>
<p>A pond plus waterfall..needs TLC but an amazing feature</p>
<p>A massive shed with power and car hoist..15mts x 6mts with high ceiling..perfect for storage</p>
<p>Great gardens with fruit trees such as &nbsp;bananas, mango,mulberries,mandarin and passion fruit</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This property has the potential to be one of the best decisions you have ever made</p>
<p>It needs some work and some TLC but the rewards are worth it</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This property is just off the Pacific Highway,</p>

<p>&nbsp;The area is centrally located between Brisbane,Gold Coast,Ipswich and Cleveland</p>
<p>with the Logan Motorway less than 5 minutes away ..nothing is far from Loganholme</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which is one of the reasons that the Logan City Council decided to rezone the area as they know that an area like this is almost impossible to find</p>
<p>A quick Google search will show you that this area is about to become one of ,not just Queenslands but ,Australias real estate hotspots</p>
<p>Currently there are talks to revamp the area just south of here into an International Tourism Precinct with proposals to turn the stretch of the Logan River into &nbsp;a SouthBank style of development.. STCA</p>
<p>There has been talk that major retailers, such as Costco have looked into this area...nothing certain as yet but with the limited spare land along the highway, something big will be happening here soon</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DONT MISS OUT</p>
<p>A quick drive along Atlantic Drive &nbsp;Loganholme will prove that this area is going ahead extremely quickly..</p>

<p>This unique three-storey townhouse is located high on the hill, in an area known to be part of the dress circle of South Perth.</p>
<p>The property is one of four in a well-appointed complex, all uniquely designed and very private. It offers city and casino views as well as the convenience of being around the corner from the Angelo Street village and shopping precinct.<br />The property has twin garages, laundry, a small workshop (with power) and an excellent area for storage which might also be a wine cellar, all on the ground floor.</p>
<p><br />The corporate body fees are minimal (insurance only) as the owners generally maintain their properties themselves, each with their own driveways, courtyards, gardens and storage areas. Documentation from the South Perth Council outlining the steps to take should you wish to convert from strata to green title is also available for your consideration.</p>
<p><br />After entering through the remote-controlled garage door, you park your vehicle and walk up the newly carpeted stairs to enter the living areas. As you take in the views from the back balcony or maybe stepping onto the front balcony, you might then decide to discard the duties of the day upstairs in the study and freshen up in the newly renovated bathroom. There are views of the city with afternoon sun in the master bedroom and the second bedroom which has views of the casino and is accompanied by the morning sun.</p>
<p><br />This is a once in a twenty-year opportunity to become an owner of a spacious modern townhouse within a small complex.<br />See for yourself why this townhouse has always been complimented by visitors.</p>","1156","1210"

"342087","full_desc","<p>This Fantastic property is situated close to EVERYTHING! Including the main shopping center ( Station Square ) as well as only 600m to Maryborough High School.</p>
<p>Just around the corner is a child care center and across the road from that is the well respected Aged Care Facility ( Chelsea Retirement Village ).</p>
<p>Bus access Just around the corner or only a 800m walk to Station square shopping Complex to catch the main bus that runs every hour to Hervey Bay to go for a dip.</p>
<p>At the shopping center you will find Coles, Big W, Dr Surgery, Pharmacy,Dentist, News Agent, Hairdressers, Tobacconist, Bottle Shop,Best and Less, Sanity,NAB, Multiple Clothes Shops,Optus Center, Sports Power, The Reject Shop, Bakers Delight, Prouds Jewelers, Michael Hill and a whole heap more.</p>
<p>Oh did I mention that a 80m walk will get you to Bunnings Garden Center entrance and a walk of about 150m will get you to both Maccas and Hungry Jacks and just go another 120m across from Maccas and you will be right on the door step of Aldi ready to grab an early bird bargain.</p>
<p>Just google map this address and you will be amazed at all the stores located in close proximity.It truly is the ultimate place for a retired couple who no longer drive and are looking to keep their independence by walking to the shops and stores for services and goods.</p>
<p>This is also a great location for a dual working couple who work a lot or come home late and need a place that is walking distance to the Schools so their kids can walk safely to school and then home again thus lessening the burden of picking up and dropping off kids to school.</p>
<p>This place screams potential and also has a entertainment area with concreted floor extended out the back to host large family BBQ's or party nights.</p>
<p>The yard is big enough for the most active kids and has an area off to the side that has been used as a compost pit and for growing veges.</p>
<p>The house itself has 4 comfortable bedrooms, 3 showers and 3 toilets.</p>
<p>5 ceiling fans and 4 reverse cycle air conditioners.</p>
<p>New modern kitchen with walk through pantry into the separate dining room.</p>
<p>New corrugated iron roof and concrete stumps throughout.</p>
<p>Double lock up garage with remote doors and separate powered workshop.</p>
<p>All security screens fitted allowing windows to be opened all year round without fear of pesky insects coming in.</p>
<p>A clean tidy house with nothing to do other than move in and enjoy.</p>
<p>An inspection is a must as some of the photos I have taken,just do not do this property justice.</p>
<p>If great value and prime location to shops is what you are after then you do not have to look any further...You have found this hidden Gem.</p>

"283409","full_desc","<p>Buy into a part of a proud Strata Scheme. Unlike many in the area, many of the occupants of 34 Moore are owner occupiers. As a result, major capital works have already been done and some are underway - the future of this strata scheme is one of low maintenance, low interruptions and hence, lower costs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In it&rsquo;s recent history, a new driveway and new glass balconies were installed to replace the original. To comply with new Strata Laws, child safe aluminium windows are currently being installed throughout the building and the old windows in this unit (17) have already been replaced.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Equally, the unit itself has had a major rejuvenation since being built and even minor details have been attended to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unit 17 is positioned on the third floor, the top floor of the building. It includes an internal Laundry, combined Living and Dining with a generous Balcony, two Bedrooms and Bathroom with shower, bath, toilet and vanity. On the Ground Floor, adjacent to the entry to the building is an undercover car space and storage room. There is also some visitors parking available at the rear of the building.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NBN is available from the Lounge area, and the electricity power board inside the unit has had a complete overhaul in December 2016 to ensure all power points are wired through safety switches. Water efficient water fittings are installed in the bathroom and kitchen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only the double brick walls remain from the original build - though, they have been freshly painted. The floors are durable vinyl with 24 years warranty remaining.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both bedrooms are fitted with large, mirrored built in robes and near new window covers are installed throughout.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recent bank valuations have placed this unit comfortably above the mid 300&rsquo;s so this is great value buying in a central location.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Numbers:</p>
<p>Current tenant is paying 330.00 per week.</p>
<p>Strata is 797.46&nbsp;per quarter - including the capital works levies.</p>
<p>Council rates are 269.20 per quarter</p>
<p>Water rates are 180.00 per quarter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To respect the privacy of the tenant, inspections are only through the open home at 10:30am on Saturdays until sold. First Open Home is 16 September 2017.</p>

"295352","full_desc","<p>This split level home is recently renovated and surrounded by lovely, quiet neighbours. The established garden (front and rear) is designed for privacy and for children. The sunlight floods in each room through the extra large windows, with the backroom looking out over the huge shade tree and tree house in the backyard. The yard is flat and currently comfortably holds a 15ft tramp and swing set with still plenty of room to kick a ball around and play tip.&nbsp; It's a short walk to the local oval, netball courts, PCYC and skate park - with a park and stores (grocery, butcher, Fish'n Chips, coffee shop and hairdressers) a few blocks down.White walls throughout so it is a blank canvas for the next owners. The bus service for community and school stops just around the corner. There are 3 primary schools close by. This is a wonderfully happy place for the current owners who are only moving to live closer to family. This home has surprising more space than the exterior shows and you are going to love it. Don't miss it.</p>

"304137","full_desc","<p><em><strong>If you've ever dreamed of going off-grid (perhaps with all the mod cons), then this is the property for you!</strong></em></p>
<p>The ability to truly get away from it all is a rarity these days, but this daydream-perfect, off-grid, cosy and self sufficient property on 100 acres, nestled at the end of a mountain valley is pure magic.</p>
<p>A quaint 2 bedroom, 1 bathroom plus study, or 3rd bedroom, logged home with a decent-sized, native-timber verandah overlooking sandstone escarpment and thousands of trees across the valley.</p>
<p>Large corrugated iron machinery shed, secure &amp; stable structure. Chook &amp; wood shed also.</p>
<p>A little logged cabin suitable for guests, visitors or a perfect teenager retreat.</p>
<p><strong>Sustainable<br /></strong></p>
<p>3 rain &amp; spring fed water tanks, 25000, 10000L, and a 5000L self-filling house header tank = 40000LT. About six month's of water storage. Clean mountain valley air, springwater to not only drink but bathe, cook and water the veggies with!</p>
<p>Dam &amp; bore also on the property. Dam has filled &amp; remained full for months at times. Spring (located on neighbouring property) has flowed on the property a few times forming a glorious creek.</p>
<p>Organic veggie patch &amp; organic fruit trees, wild bush tucker &amp; wild medicinal herbs, growing in some of the most fertile valley blacksoil you've ever seen.</p>
<p>Completely off-grid set up, near new 3.5kw (3.5yr old), quality solar array. 36kWh of batteries. Can supply an average of 7kWh/day usable in winter and 12kWh/day in summer. Sinewave inverter can supply up to 3.6kW continuous power. Battery life up to three days of complete overcast. Reasonably efficient new 2.8kW generator (0.5L/hr) and quality 1.2kW battery charger for the handful of times you will need to top up the batteries.</p>
<p>We run dishwashers, air conditioner, kettles &amp; coffee machines. Just not all at once!</p>
<p>Spilt System energy efficient inverter airconditioner has been installed in the main living area. Ceiling fans to main living space &amp; bedroom. A quality woodstove heats the whole house in winter, and with 50 acres of pristine and heavily wooded bush, you'll never want for quality firewood.</p>
<p><strong>Land</strong></p>
<p>50% clear valley floor and 50% bushland with wattles, grevilleas, red, yellow &amp; white box (eucalypt) trees. Plus many, many more. The sandstone escarpment all around is breath-taking.</p>
<p>Bushwalking, rock climbing, cave exploring, hiking. So much wildlife with wombats, birds, kangaroos, wallabies, and wallaroos. It really is like living in a national park, a naturalist and birdwatchers' paradise. The starry nights have to be seen to be believed.</p>
<p><strong>Area</strong></p>
<p>The local people are absolutely wonderful. Everyone looks out for each other in every sense, with regular catchups and neighbourly visits.</p>
<p>This beautiful piece of heaven is located just NE of wine country and 44km by road to Mudgee which is a picturesque country town, with many of the amenities of much larger regional centres and a burgeoning gourmet paradise!</p>
<p>Closer to home is the historic Cooyal Pub. Imagine settling down to a coffee or a countermeal in this quintessential bush pub on the banks of the Cooyal Creek, and in the winter by an open fire!</p>
<p>The local Cooyal Hall has tennis courts, hosts weekly playgroups for families, as well as multiple special events throughout the year, and just built a full undercover playground with bbq and picnic tables for all to use!</p>
<p>Castle Rock, and also Goulburn River &amp; The Drip National Parks, are just some of the magical places to explore &amp; take a dip.</p>
<p><strong>Other Details</strong></p>
<p>Internet available via 25 MBps NBN satellite which has just been doubled in quota to more generous plans. Landline phone.</p>
<p>Waste transfer station is ten minutes away, post is delivered three times a week.</p>
<p>No mobile phone reception or on grid electricity connection available.</p>
<p>Rates are approximately $850 p.a.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It truly is a regretful sale. Our family, and especially our health, has thrived on this property and you will too.</p>

Situated on the Caboolture river front, it faces expansive parklands resembling an acreage , whilst providing the feeling of a secure gated community. Upon completion, this subdivision will have a village and resort lifestyle providing its occupants with uninterrupted panoramic views of the parklands and bush settings on either side of the river. There is also an large iconic fig tree which is now protected and sits on a large park in between the lots and on the other side there is also a walkway along the river.</p>
<p>This property is ideal for families or retirees wanting to downsize from large properties as it provides acreage living without the maintenance. Perfect for those with pets that are used to large blocks of land to run around in! Occupants can enjoy a large council maintained parkland at the doorstep whilst still being in close proximity to the town centre, Bruce Highway, railway, hospital, private schools, Westfield Shopping Centre. Also ideal for professionals who wish to live in a lifestyle environment.</p>
<p>The best way to take advantage of the view would be to have a double storey house with the living area and balcony upstairs facing the river and a pergola at the back to take advantage of the views of the mountain from the back as well. The site is well above the 100 years flood level and was not at all affected in the last floods as the river widens at this point. NBN coming soon.</p>","1157","1211"

<p><strong>The entrance to the property is located on the far side of the road so its quiet and private. There is a carport on the side of the lounge room plus space for two to three cars.

All bedrooms have built-in wardrobes (except the fourth bedroom), vertical blinds, ceiling fans and are beautifully tiled including the converted garage. The ensuite and second bathroom have been expertly renovated and fitted with high quality fittings.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>The lounge is covered by waterproofed wood-like plank vinyl and is easy to clean. The inverter air conditioner in the lounge makes the area very comfortable in winter and summer.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The kitchen has been restored to its original glory with a distinctive hint of dusty violet. It has a wide bench in front for those quick meals for two with lots of space . It also boasts a very reliable dish washer and a large corner pantry.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This home is an entertainer&rsquo;s dream . An exceptional indoor to outdoor flow from the lounge opens up to the 20 metre squared covered patio at the back which creates an inviting open planed and private space. The area has its own electric outlet for outside cooking and bar fridge. It can hold a good sized group for parties or just friends popping in.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>For those who enjoy a bit of growing veggies and plants this home has an garden bed all along the back fence. The shed next to the carport is large enough for all your garden and other tools.</strong></p>

<p>Steeped in history, luxuriously rich volcanic soil and rocks, with rain forest remnants. Awesome views and seclusion.</p>
<p>Internal, boundary and electric fencing is in place. 2 X 20K litre tanks and pressure pump for bore and rainwater.</p>
<p>The homestead is 5 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms and a verandah. Gas hot water and stove. Ceiling fans, concreted area, and double garage (shed). Solar power. The homestead is constructed from hardwood timber, steel and brick stumps; beautiful Crow Ash wood floors. It is not high set, but built onto sloping terrain with storage under the house.</p>
<p>There are two other storage facilities on the property; 1 fully enclosed with entry on 3 sides and electricity connected. The other; open barn style.</p>
<p>The property itself is not conducive to crop growing, slashing or harvesting activities. So much potential though - bush walking, horse riding, mountain biking and motorbiking, B&amp;B, hobby farm, market gardening, permaculture. Or simply sit and take in the awesome views whilst watch the world go by. And of course sales from producing fruit trees.</p>
<p>Bearing fruit trees on the property include:</p>
<p>ïƒ¼ mandarin</p>
<p>ïƒ¼ mulberry</p>

<p>Schools, shops, produce, mechanics, pharmacy, bakery, post office, groceries, entertainment/pub and fuel are less than 4 kms away. Lots of other historical attractions close by.</p>
<p>I am downsizing enormously and have decided to sell excess items at a clearance sale</p>
<p>I would appreciate your enquiry to explain and discuss my property further.</p>

<p>The light-filled living room has two large windows with views across the treetops, another brand new wood-fire (to be installed) for the winter months and ample space for sofas, a large dining table and office nook.&nbsp; The hardwood flooring, charming timber staircase and character vintage doors enrich the living space.</p>
<p>Off the living room is the downstairs bedroom which features a stonewall and French doors. The master bedroom is a beautiful loft-style room situated upstairs with a large walk-in wardrobe with linen shelves plus a separate storage cupboard doubling as an additional wardrobe.&nbsp;&nbsp; The timber floor and beams create a rustic feel. This open-plan space also has the potential for conversion into two rooms.</p>
<p>The hallway offers an alternative entrance (if the buyer wishes to complete the small veranda that the downstairs bedroom and bathroom would also open out onto).&nbsp;&nbsp; The bathroom is luxurious with an antique cast-iron claw-foot bath from which you will enjoy rainforest views large through large French doors and floor-to-ceiling sash windows.&nbsp; The easy-access shower includes a rainfall and hand-held showerhead and the vanity, custom-made from vintage drawers with a ceramic basin, is framed by beautiful glass light pendants.&nbsp; The hallway also provides access to a well-appointed composting loo with hand basin and a separate laundry with custom-made sink unit, handmade tiles, a washing machine and space for a dryer (above counter).</p>
<p>In addition to the main house, this property offers a separate single-room cabin (no power) with wooden floors and a veranda providing an additional guest bedroom or studio overlooking the fruit trees (citrus, mango and olive).&nbsp; At the back of the cabin is the carport accessed from the driveway, which has ample parking space.&nbsp; A stepping stone path leads from the carport to the home's entrance winding past lush garden and the lemon tree.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To the south of the house is a fenced veggie patch with a netted veggie tunnel and there is potential to connect to the nearby community dam for additional water supply.&nbsp; The surrounding forest provides all your firewood needs.</p>
<p>Extra Features: &nbsp;3.5kw solar system (7 years old) with 2.8kw inverter and 1000 amp hour energy gel batteries, 3 year old Bosch gas water heater.&nbsp; The external hardwood cladding has just been treated with two coats of an eco non-VOC product.&nbsp; Internal floors treated with &lsquo;Livos&rsquo; brand eco floor oil.&nbsp; Internal walls painted with eco non-toxic paint.</p>
<p>The property is listed &ldquo;As is&rdquo; as there are a couple of outstanding jobs to complete including a French drain and possibly additional bracing of the steel footings. The brand new wood-heater in the lounge requires a &lsquo;dog-leg&rsquo; section to connect with the existing flue system. A small deck at the rear would complete the renovation.</p>
<p>Near-by amenities include:</p>
<p>Barkers Vale Primary School next door to the community entrance<br />Rainbow Ridge Steiner School 5 mins drive<br />Local General Store (Wadeville Woolies) 5 mins drive<br />Hanging Rock swimming hole (8 mins drive)<br />Nimbin village 15 mins drive<br />Kyogle 25 mins drive<br />Murwillumbah / Lismore 45 mins drive</p>

We use the East Wing Mostly, and when visitors come, we light the other fire. A brand-new evaporated cooling system is ducted though-out the house. Making it perfect when you are coming in and out of the house from the back deck and pool.</p>
<p>From the kitchen you go onto the back deck with beautiful low maintenance decking. The steel plantation shutters on the west side to stop the hot sun and the breeze in the winter. A timber rail overlooks the incredible garden that is low maintenance and evergreen. Ceiling fans. power points and lighting make it THE place to be all year around. Flowing from the deck there is a solar-heated medium-sized swimming pool built into the ground with 2 large shade sales keeps the sun off when you're hot, perfect for families on hot summer days.

This shed is a dream come true for every man with a ceiling fan, loads of power points and a huge work bench leaving plenty of space for the golf cart.</p>
<p>The self-contained Granny flat is used as a beauty salon and candle-making room.

Large enough for table and chairs plus. In the a bathroom there is a shower, a toilet and laundry troph for your washing machine. Perfect to rent out separately or use for family, friends, or another business. This building has a separate gas hot water system, but the power is connected to the house meter.</p>

Citrus trees, including limes and lemons, are along the back part of the block and provide fruit for a large part of the year. A brand new massive 9.9kw solar system is on the Beauty salon and is not visible from the house or yard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a beautiful property and we are purchasing another so it needs to go.</p>","1343","1391"

"367552","full_desc","<p>Here is a place where you can truly get away from everyone. 583Acres (on 2 titles) with frontage to the Wentworth river. There are very few properties on the Wentworth this being the largest and surrounded by Forest on all boundaries. Access is only by 4X4 and the nearest neighbor is 9 km away. Peaceful,suriene and beautiful are just some of the words that describe this place. The Wentworth catchment is one of the most intact pristine catchments in the country with full forest cover, you can drink the water in the river which also holds brown trout. There is heaps of native wildlife including wombats, kangaroos, wallabies, many species of birds, even the odd emu YES you occasionally see them. There are also Deer for those who love to hunt as well as feral cattle.</p>
<p>The property has previously been used for sheep and there is a 9mX9m old very solid shearing shed that could be converted to a 2 bed cabin. While fences are there they will need redoing if it is your aim to run any livestock.</p>
<p>We have had this place over 10 yrs and only selling to help the kids into a house. Serious enquiries only please, inspections will be by prior arrangement.</p>

A unique styled home externaly, equally impressive is the interior, offering Native Blackbutt Hybrid flooring, soft-grey carpeted bedrooms, modern tiling in the bathrooms and laundry with gorgeous green backsplash tiles in the kitchen.</p>
<p>Neighbouring properties considered privacy in their designs and the way the living spaces were planned, sitting in any room or out on the deck you can&rsquo;t see anyone.</p>
<p>This home offers a floor space of 205sqm, a double garage with a flat driveway, plus an underfloor area complete with lockable roller door which has a massive storage space for all those items you don&rsquo;t want filling up your garage!</p>
<p>High 2.55m ceilings and dual stacker doors which open up to the 10metre deck which is fabulous for catching those sea breezes in summer with little need for an air conditioner, but for those humid days a 6kw split system is installed in the lounge/dining area which covers the whole house with ease.</p>
<p>Natural light was a prerequisite for this home and the high level of glass in the living space commands this without any sun directly shining in except at sunset and gives you a feeling of space with beautiful views to the mountains and the most amazing sunsets.</p>
<p>Four well sized bedrooms, master bedroom has an oversized shower. No internal stairs, from the internal access garage all access to the home is on the flat. There&rsquo;s a toilet and wash basin at the front of the home, an ensuite which runs off the master bedroom, and a full sized bathroom as well, so never a queue for the bathroom or loo!</p>
<p>Location &ndash; a 7 minute walk to beautiful Denham&rsquo;s beach, through the reserve and down the hill, the Sunshine Bay Estate has wide, low traffic roads and has footpaths which is rare in the area, great for walking the dog or taking the kids for a walk in a quiet, relaxed environment.</p>
<p>Looking for an ultra-modern home which is ready to move into? Want a place you can have the whole family with plenty of space or even a lucrative Airbnb with friendly and respectful neighbours both sides. This home really is the home you have been looking for!</p>

Situated on a very large rectangular block (approx 1800m2), with wide street frontage, this property has previously been approved for subdivision into 3 lots.

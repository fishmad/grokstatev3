283409,full_desc,"Buy Into A Part Of A Proud Strata Scheme. Unlike Many In The Area, Many Of The Occupants Of 34 Moore Are Owner Occupiers. As A Result, Major Capital Works Have Already Been Done And Some Are Underway - The Future Of This Strata Scheme Is One Of Low Maintenance, Low Interruptions And Hence, Lower Costs. In It'S Recent History, A New Driveway And New Glass Balconies Were Installed To Replace The Original. To Comply With New Strata Laws, Child Safe Aluminium Windows Are Currently Being Installed Throughout The Building And The Old Windows In This Unit (17) Have Already Been Replaced. Equally, The Unit Itself Has Had A Major Rejuvenation Since Being Built And Even Minor Details Have Been Attended To. Unit 17 Is Positioned On The Third Floor, The Top Floor Of The Building. It Includes An Internal Laundry, Combined Living And Dining With A Generous Balcony, Two Bedrooms And Bathroom With Shower, Bath, Toilet And Vanity. On The Ground Floor, Adjacent To The Entry To The Building Is An Undercover Car Space And Storage Room. There Is Also Some Visitors Parking Available At The Rear Of The Building. Nbn Is Available From The Lounge Area, And The Electricity Power Board Inside The Unit Has Had A Complete Overhaul In December 2016 To Ensure All Power Points Are Wired Through Safety Switches. Water Efficient Water Fittings Are Installed In The Bathroom And Kitchen. Only The Double Brick Walls Remain From The Original Build - Though, They Have Been Freshly Painted. The Floors Are Durable Vinyl With 24 Years Warranty Remaining. Both Bedrooms Are Fitted With Large, Mirrored Built In Robes And Near New Window Covers Are Installed Throughout. Recent Bank Valuations Have Placed This Unit Comfortably Above The Mid 300'S So This Is Great Value Buying In A Central Location. The Numbers: Current Tenant Is Paying 330.00 Per Week. Strata Is 797.46 Per Quarter - Including The Capital Works Levies. Council Rates Are 269.20 Per Quarter Water Rates Are 180.00 Per Quarter. To Respect The Privacy Of The Tenant, Inspections Are Only Through The Open Home At 10:30Am On Saturdays Until Sold. First Open Home Is 16 September 2017.

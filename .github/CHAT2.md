Define Super-Admin please
https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-permission/v6/basic-usage/super-admin

> Copilot: In the context of Laravel and the spatie/laravel-permission package, a "Super-Admin" is a user who has unrestricted access to all parts of your application, regardless of assigned roles or permissions. This is typically implemented by bypassing all permission checks for users with the "super-admin" role.
> 
> According to the Spatie documentation, you can define a Super-Admin by adding a global authorization override in your `AuthServiceProvider` using the Gate::before method. Here’s how you can do it:
> 
> ```php
> // In app/Providers/AuthServiceProvider.php
> 
> use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Gate;
> 
> public function boot()
> {
>     $this->registerPolicies();
> 
>     Gate::before(function ($user, $ability) {
>         return $user->role === 'super-admin' ? true : null;
>     });
> }
> ```
> 
> This code means: if the authenticated user has the role "super-admin", all permission checks will automatically return true, granting them access everywhere.
> 
> You already seed a user with the "super-admin" role in your DatabaseSeeder.php, so after adding the above code, that user will have full access.
> 
> Let me know if you want this code added to your `AuthServiceProvider.php`.

yes

> Copilot: 

@agent Continue: "Continue to iterate?"

> Copilot: The Super-Admin logic is now implemented. Your application will grant all permissions to users with the role "super-admin" as described in the Spatie documentation.
> 
> You can now use the seeded user with the email super-admin@test.com to have unrestricted access. If you have any further requirements or want to test permissions, let me know!

First duty create React Error boundary component

> Copilot: A React Error Boundary component has been created at resources/js/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx. You can now use this to catch and display errors in your React app.
> 
> Would you like to wrap your app in this ErrorBoundary next?

Why did you name it that way. can you ensure you align with this standing order

> Copilot: Thank you for pointing out your standing order. The file was named ErrorBoundary.tsx, which uses PascalCase, not kebab-case as required for React component filenames in your project.
> 
> Per your standing order:
> - All React component files must use kebab-case (e.g., error-boundary.tsx).
> - Component names inside the file should remain PascalCase (e.g., ErrorBoundary).
> 
> I will rename the file to error-boundary.tsx to comply with your conventions. The error boundary component file has been renamed to error-boundary.tsx to fully comply with your standing order. All future React component files will use kebab-case for filenames, as specified.

Summarize completed tasks from build order and update status.md

> Copilot: 
> ````
> 
> ````
> The status.md file has been updated with a summary of all completed tasks from your build order, including project setup, authentication, Super-Admin role, and error boundary integration. It also lists the next steps for your project. Let me know if you want to track progress on additional features!

I do want to track progress on build and additional features, I use two computers andI need to share progress between two machines, vs-code and CoPilot AI language and sometimes on the other computer I get a new Copilt AI who doesnt know anything about the project Ive been working on (no background informatins) and I need a way to bring them up to speed quickly, do have a suggestions to make this easier

> Copilot: To make sharing project progress and context between two computers (and different Copilot AIs) seamless, here are some best practices and concrete suggestions:
> 
> ### 1. Maintain a Single Source of Truth for Project Status
> - Keep your status.md up to date with all completed steps, current tasks, and next steps.
> - Use clear, dated entries and bullet points for each milestone or feature.
> - Add a "Last Updated" date at the top.
> 
> ### 2. Document Build Order and Conventions
> - Keep your build-order.md and copilot-instructions.md (or `COPILOT_STANDING_ORDER.md`) as the canonical guides for:
>   - Build steps
>   - Coding standards
>   - Naming conventions
>   - Tech stack and architectural decisions
>   - Copilot prompts and example code
> 
> ### 3. Add a "Quick Start for New Copilot AI" Section
> At the top of your `status.md` or in a new file like `.github/README_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, add a section such as:
> 
> ```
> # Quick Start for Copilot AI
> 
> - This project uses Laravel 12.x, React 19, Inertia.js, Tailwind CSS v4.1, ShadCN/UI, Sanctum, and Spatie Permissions.
> - All coding standards, naming conventions, and build steps are documented in `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and `.github/build-order.md`.
> - The current project status and completed steps are tracked in `.github/status.md`.
> - To get up to speed, read these three files first.
> - For any new Copilot AI: Always check `.github/status.md` for the latest progress and `.github/build-order.md` for the next steps and prompts.
> ```
> 
> ### 4. Use Git for Synchronization
> - Commit and push your .github folder and all documentation to your remote repository.
> - On each machine, always `git pull` before starting work and `git push` after making progress.
> 
> ### 5. Add a "README.md" at the Project Root
> - Summarize the above points and direct any new developer or Copilot AI to the .github folder for all context.
> 
> ---
> 
> **Summary:**  
> Keep your status.md, build-order.md, and copilot-instructions.md (or `COPILOT_STANDING_ORDER.md`) up to date and in sync via Git. Add a "Quick Start" section for new Copilot AIs. This ensures any Copilot instance or developer can get up to speed quickly, regardless of which machine or session they're on.
> 
> Would you like me to generate a sample "Quick Start for Copilot AI" section or a root `README.md` for your project?

yes

> Copilot: A new file, README_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md, has been created at the project root. It provides a "Quick Start" guide for Copilot AI and developers, explaining where to find project context, how to sync progress, and how to get up to speed on any machine. This will help ensure seamless handoff and onboarding for both Copilot and human collaborators.
> 
> Let me know if you want this linked or referenced in other documentation!

So should I rename these file to better found by COPILT?

> Copilot: Yes, you should rename your key project meta files for maximum discoverability by GitHub Copilot and other AI/codegen tools. The recommended names are:
> 
> - copilot-instructions.md → `.github/COPILOT_STANDING_ORDER.md`
> - build-order.md → `.github/BUILD_ORDER.md`
> - status.md → STATUS.md
> 
> These names are more likely to be recognized and prioritized by Copilot and similar tools, as they follow the convention of all-caps, underscore-separated filenames for project-wide instructions and status. This will help ensure that your coding standards, build steps, and project status are always found and followed by Copilot, other AIs, and new developers.
> 
> Would you like me to rename these files for you now?

yes please

> Copilot: All three files have been successfully renamed for maximum Copilot and AI discoverability:
> 
> - copilot-instructions.md → COPILOT_STANDING_ORDER.md
> - `.github/build-order.md` → BUILD_ORDER.md
> - status.md → STATUS.md
> 
> Your project context, build steps, and coding standards are now easier for Copilot and other agents to find and follow. You can proceed with your next build steps as outlined in `BUILD_ORDER.md`.

The standing order identifies controller views should exist in their own subfolder structure to contain the /pages from too much clutter as project develops, if these instructions are clear enough can you provide guidance on how I can better structure the standing order to reflect this requirement

> Copilot: To make your standing order clearer and more actionable for Copilot and developers regarding controller view organization, update the relevant section to:
> 
> - Explicitly require that each resource/controller has its own subfolder under `resources/ts/pages/` (or pages), named after the resource in plural kebab-case (e.g., `properties`, `categories`, `features`).
> - Specify that all views/pages for a resource must go inside this subfolder, and filenames should be prefixed with the resource name (e.g., `properties_index.tsx`, `properties_create.tsx`).

The filename examples in my standing order need to reflect dashes between file-names, not under_scores in file names this needs to be amended, can you please update the sections in the file as per your recommendation about and ensure it also meets the below standard.
Filenames: kebab-case
Component names: kebab-case
Example: property-card.tsx

I have a general question about the users public part of frontend vs the dedicated admin area.

The public area will have for example:

      - `resources/ts/pages/properties/properties-create.tsx`
      - `resources/ts/pages/properties/properties-show.tsx`
      - `resources/ts/pages/properties/properties-edit.tsx`
would the admin area just re-use those pages, or is it better to create admin specific varients and import relavant shared components?

> Copilot: Great question! For a scalable, maintainable project, **it’s best to create admin-specific variants of pages** for the admin area, rather than re-using public-facing pages directly.
> 
> ### Why?
> - **Different requirements:** Admin pages often need extra controls, data, or permissions not suitable for public users.
> - **UI/UX differences:** Admin interfaces typically have different layouts, navigation, and workflows.
> - **Security:** Keeping admin logic separate reduces the risk of exposing sensitive features to public users.
> - **Easier maintenance:** Changes to admin features won’t accidentally affect the public site, and vice versa.
> 
> ### Recommended Structure
> 
> - **Public pages:**  
>   - `resources/ts/pages/properties/properties-show.tsx`
>   - `resources/ts/pages/properties/properties-create.tsx`
>   - `resources/ts/pages/properties/properties-edit.tsx`
> 
> - **Admin pages:**  
>   - `resources/ts/pages/admin/properties/properties-index.tsx`
>   - `resources/ts/pages/admin/properties/properties-create.tsx`
>   - `resources/ts/pages/admin/properties/properties-edit.tsx`
>   - `resources/ts/pages/admin/properties/properties-show.tsx`
> 
> - **Shared components:**  
>   Place reusable UI or logic in `resources/ts/components/` (e.g., `property-form.tsx`, `property-card.tsx`) and import them in both public and admin pages as needed.
> 
> ### Summary
> - **Do not** re-use public pages directly for admin.
> - **Do** create admin-specific pages under an `admin/` subfolder.
> - **Do** extract and share components for forms, tables, cards, etc.
> 
> This approach keeps your codebase organized, secure, and easy to extend. If you want, I can update your standing order to reflect this best practice!

Please update the standing in order to reflect, because that's definitely something I'm going to be doing.

Please update my standing order to reflect the changes above that we both agreed upon and can you add to the build order the relevance to this in the administration section when we get to it?

> Your standing order has been updated to explicitly require:

All my .tsx and .ts types files are located in a /js folder under the resources/ not /ts.
      - `resources/js/pages/properties/properties-index.tsx`
      - `resources/js/pages/properties/properties-create.tsx`
      - `resources/js/pages/properties/properties-show.tsx`
      - `resources/js/pages/properties/properties-edit.tsx`

In the example of this folder structure for public and where it will be mostly replicated to some degree in the admin area and will share some custom properties page components will be created ie, a card for agent avatar/seller, agent-card.txt and its a shared /component that will pertain specifically to the /properties it thinks it will make more sense to me to have those components stores in a resource specific directory under components like: resources/js/components/properties ?? shared page-forms, components ect - 


> Copilot: Absolutely, your approach is sound and will help keep your project organized as it grows.
> 
> ### Updated Best Practice for Your Project
> 
> **1. All .tsx and .ts files are under js (not `/ts/`).**  
> Update all examples and documentation to use js.
> 
> **2. Resource-Specific Components:**  
> For components that are only relevant to a specific resource (like properties), store them in a resource-specific subfolder under `components`:
> - `resources/js/components/properties/property-card.tsx`
> - `resources/js/components/properties/agent-card.tsx`
> - `resources/js/components/properties/property-form.tsx`
> 
> **3. Shared/Generic Components:**  
> For components used across multiple resources, use a `shared/` or `common/` folder:
> - `resources/js/components/shared/modal.tsx`
> - `resources/js/components/shared/button.tsx`
> 
> **4. Page Structure:**  
> - Public pages:  
>   - `resources/js/pages/properties/properties-index.tsx`
>   - `resources/js/pages/properties/properties-create.tsx`
> - Admin pages:  
>   - `resources/js/pages/admin/properties/properties-index.tsx`
>   - `resources/js/pages/admin/properties/properties-create.tsx`

update your standing order and build order files with these changes?

 Sorry, my last reply was in relation to updating the standard order and build order files with the changes from above in terms of file naming conventions and shared directories. Can we please update those documents with those changes above?

The app sidebar file that I have here is the main menu item listed for the dashboard part of the site. So I wanted to add a new requirement to the standing order that anytime a new view is created or a resource and you're updating the web route file or API file relevant to that document that we can add a menu item in here automatically as part of that process so that I have direct UI access to it shortly after the build.

This ensures direct UI access to new resources or views immediately after each build.

Are you able to add a menu item there now for properties?

Can you move the properties, edit CRUD resource views into their designated folder location and update the routes?

Has the Web Brouts folder been updated to reflect that or is it OK and the menu item in the dashboard?

> Copilot: Yes, the web routes file (web.php) is already correct and does not need further changes for the move, as the controller method names and route paths remain the same. The only required update was in the controller's Inertia view paths, which has already been completed.

OK so where are we up to with the status?

Can we implement some of the property management CRUD?

> Copilot: Yes, property management CRUD is already scaffolded and partially implemented in your project. Here’s what is already in place and what can be improved or completed:

> - Sidebar menu item for "Properties" is present
> 
> **To improve/complete:**
> - Implement full form handling and submission in the React views (currently, forms are present but may not POST to the backend)
> - Add Inertia form handling (using `@inertiajs/react` form helpers)
> - Ensure all fields (including selects for property types, categories, features, etc.) are present and wired up in the create/edit forms
> - Add delete functionality (button and confirmation) in the show or index view
> 
> Would you like to start by making the edit and create forms fully functional, including select fields and form submission? Or do you want to focus on another CRUD aspect (e.g., delete, list, show)? Please specify which part you want to implement first, or I can proceed with making the edit/create forms fully functional.

Yes, I would. I can't see any content within the files, they look empty, so I don't know what's happened there.

Yeah I tried that already, I think we have dupplications going on with this migrate all file 0001_01_01_000004_create_realty_table

> Copilot: You are correct—if you have both a legacy or custom migration like `0001_01_01_000004_create_realty_table` and a newer migration that both create the `addresses` table, this will cause a duplicate table error.

So on this file I have these other tables in here mixed table groups but they don't exist as a migration. Are you able to look at the the project scope and see if these are meant to be independent migrations and models?

> Copilot: Based on your project conventions and the build order documentation, the tables in 0001_01_01_000004_create_realty_table.php—namely:

Can you create four separate migrations for each one of these? Because I want to see the pivot tables specifically in the migration order.

> Copilot: Four separate migration files have been created for each pivot table:
> 
> - `2025_06_04_060001_create_property_category_table.php`

> - `2025_06_04_060004_create_property_agent_table.php`
> 
> You can now see and manage each pivot table migration independently and in order. You should remove these table definitions from the original 0001_01_01_000004_create_realty_table.php to avoid duplicate table errors. Would you like me to do that next?

OK all the migrations and seeders are now running properly. Um, I think the next thing is I'm looking at the properties table and it's got next to nothing in it. We need to look back at the project and see what fields and stuff we need to create for this.

> Copilot:

do I need to install @inertiajs/inertia in my Laravel 12 React Starter Kit, it seems to work fine without https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/starter-kits#available-starter-kits
https://github.com/laravel/react-starter-kit

> Copilot: No, you do not need to install `@inertiajs/inertia` separately in your Laravel 12 React Starter Kit project.
> 
> Your package.json already includes `"@inertiajs/react": "^2.0.0"`. As of `@inertiajs/react` version 1.0.0 and later, the core Inertia.js functionality is bundled within the React adapter itself.

SO how do I use my already installed "@inertiajs/react": "^2.0.0" for this instead installing yet another dependency

> Copilot: You're on the right track! The `@inertiajs/react` package provides the `useForm` hook, which is designed to handle form state, submissions (including file uploads), and errors gracefully. You are already using it to manage your form `data` and have access to the `post` method from it.
> 
> Here's how you can modify your properties-create.tsx to use the `post` method from `useForm` for submission, which is the standard way with `@inertiajs/react`:
> 
> **1. Integrate `media` into the `useForm` hook's state:**
> 
>    Instead of managing `media` with a separate `React.useState`, include it in the `initialValues` of `useForm`.
>

> 
>    Modify the `onChange` handler of your media file input to use `setData` to update `data.media`.
> 
> **3. Simplify the `handleSubmit` function:**
>

> **Key changes:**
> 1.  **Removed `Inertia` import:** `import { Inertia } from '@inertiajs/inertia';` is no longer needed for this form's submission.
> 2.  **`media` in `useForm`:** Added `media: null as FileList | null,` to the `useForm` initial data.
> 3.  **`setData` for media:** The file input's `onChange` now calls `setData('media', e.target.files)`.
> 4.  **Simplified `handleSubmit`:** It now directly calls `post('/properties')`. The `useForm` hook handles the `FormData` creation internally when `data.media` contains files.
> 5.  **Removed separate `media` state:** `const [media, setMedia] = React.useState<FileList | null>(null);` is no longer needed.
> 6.  **Added `progress` from `useForm`:** This is useful for showing upload progress for files.
> 7.  **`setData` in `useEffect` dependency array:** Added `setData` to the dependency array of the `useEffect` for `dynamic_attributes` as per ESLint best practices, though its direct impact here might be minimal if `setData` itself is stable.

> By making these changes, you are leveraging the intended functionality of `@inertiajs/react`'s `useForm` hook, which simplifies form handling, especially with file uploads.

Okay thanks can you update it as needed

> Copilot: I'll update your form submission code to properly use the built-in features of `@inertiajs/react` for handling file uploads. Let me implement that for you.
> 
> First, let's examine your current code and then make the necessary changes: I'll update the properties-create.tsx file to properly use the `useForm` hook from @inertiajs/react instead of manually creating FormData with @inertiajs/inertia. Let me examine the code first to understand what needs to be changed.

> It seems there might be some issues with the file edit. Let me try a more comprehensive approach with a single edit that fixes all issues: I can see that a previous edit has accidentally corrupted the file. Let me get the original content again and then make a complete fresh edit to fix the issues: It looks like the file is corrupted from a previous edit. Let me create a completely new file with the fixed code: 

yes it appears corupted

> Copilot: I can see that the properties-create.tsx file is corrupted. There seems to be some issues with the imports and component structure. Let me fix it for you.

> Let me read the full file to understand its current state: I'll help you fix the corrupted properties-create.tsx file. Looking at the file, I can see there's some malformed code in the imports section where it seems HTML for the file upload component was accidentally inserted into the middle of an import statement.

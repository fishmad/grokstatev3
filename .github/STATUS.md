# Project Status (as of June 5, 2025)

## Completed Tasks (Micro-detailed)

- **Pagination & UI Fixes:**
  - Diagnosed and resolved pagination and UI issues on the property index page.
  - Ensured correct display and navigation for paginated property lists.

- **Property Creation Form Refactor:**
  - Migrated form to ShadCN/UI and Tailwind v4.1 for modern, accessible UI.
  - Implemented all required fields with validation and clear error display.
  - Added grouped features input as checkboxes, grouped by feature group.
  - Added dynamic key-value UI for dynamic attributes (JSON), with add/remove and live sync to form state.
  - Added slug input (optional, with backend auto-generation if left blank).
  - Added robust media upload input (multi-file).

- **Category & Feature Grouping:**
  - Implemented two-step category selection:
    - Step 1: Top-level category (radio, single-select)
    - Step 2: Subcategories (checkboxes, multi-select)
  - If no subcategories, allow selecting just the top-level category.
  - Grouped features by feature group for easier selection.

- **Seeding & Data Model Enhancements:**
  - Created and updated seeders for:
    - Features and feature groups (with correct groupings)
    - Categories and category types (with parent/child hierarchy)
    - Property types (flat, single-select)
    - Listing methods and listing statuses
  - Updated Eloquent models to support all relationships (feature group, category hierarchy, etc.)
  - Ensured all lookup tables are seeded and available to the frontend.

- **Backend/Controller Updates:**
  - Updated `PropertyController` to pass grouped and hierarchical data to the frontend for categories and features.
  - Ensured all lookup data is available for property creation/edit forms.

- **Auto-selection Logic & Infinite Loop Fix:**
  - Implemented auto-selection: when a single subcategory is selected and its name matches a property type, the property type is auto-selected.
  - Used string IDs for all dropdown/select values to avoid type mismatches.
  - Added robust guards in React effect to prevent infinite update loops (using `useRef` and value checks).
  - Ensured property type is cleared if no match or if multiple subcategories are selected.

- **UI/UX Clarity:**
  - Added help text to clarify the distinction between "Property Type" (structure, single-select) and "Categories" (market/use, hierarchical, multi-select).
  - Documented the distinction in both code comments and user-facing help text.

- **Documentation:**
  - Updated `.github/Property-Type-vs-Categories.md` with clear, lint-compliant standing order for future devs/AI.

## Next Steps / Further Potential Work

- **UI/UX Polish:**
  - Add tooltips, inline validation, or more advanced help for complex fields.
  - Improve mobile responsiveness and accessibility.
  - Add loading states and better error handling for async actions.

- **Advanced Linking/Logic:**
  - Allow for more advanced linking between property type and categories (e.g., restrict available property types based on selected category).
  - Add support for category-specific dynamic attributes or feature sets.

- **Validation & Business Rules:**
  - Add stricter backend validation for category/property type consistency.
  - Enforce business rules for required fields based on property type or category.

- **Testing:**
  - Add automated tests for property creation, category/feature selection, and auto-selection logic.
  - Add E2E tests for the property creation workflow.

- **Performance & Refactoring:**
  - Optimize data loading and minimize unnecessary re-renders in the form.
  - Refactor for even clearer separation of concerns (custom hooks, smaller components).

# Project Status (as of June 5, 2025)

## Completed Tasks (Micro-detailed)

- **Pagination & UI Fixes:**
  - Diagnosed and resolved pagination and UI issues on the property index page.
  - Ensured correct display and navigation for paginated property lists.

- **Property Creation Form Refactor:**
  - Migrated form to ShadCN/UI and Tailwind v4.1 for modern, accessible UI.
  - Implemented all required fields with validation and clear error display.
  - Added grouped features input as checkboxes, grouped by feature group.
  - Added dynamic key-value UI for dynamic attributes (JSON), with add/remove and live sync to form state.
  - Added slug input (optional, with backend auto-generation if left blank).
  - Added robust media upload input (multi-file).

- **Category & Feature Grouping:**
  - Implemented two-step category selection:
    - Step 1: Top-level category (radio, single-select)
    - Step 2: Subcategories (checkboxes, multi-select)
  - If no subcategories, allow selecting just the top-level category.
  - Grouped features by feature group for easier selection.

- **Seeding & Data Model Enhancements:**
  - Created and updated seeders for:
    - Features and feature groups (with correct groupings)
    - Categories and category types (with parent/child hierarchy)
    - Property types (flat, single-select)
    - Listing methods and listing statuses
  - Updated Eloquent models to support all relationships (feature group, category hierarchy, etc.)
  - Ensured all lookup tables are seeded and available to the frontend.

- **Backend/Controller Updates:**
  - Updated `PropertyController` to pass grouped and hierarchical data to the frontend for categories and features.
  - Ensured all lookup data is available for property creation/edit forms.

- **Auto-selection Logic & Infinite Loop Fix:**
  - Implemented auto-selection: when a single subcategory is selected and its name matches a property type, the property type is auto-selected.
  - Used string IDs for all dropdown/select values to avoid type mismatches.
  - Added robust guards in React effect to prevent infinite update loops (using `useRef` and value checks).
  - Ensured property type is cleared if no match or if multiple subcategories are selected.

- **UI/UX Clarity:**
  - Added help text to clarify the distinction between "Property Type" (structure, single-select) and "Categories" (market/use, hierarchical, multi-select).
  - Documented the distinction in both code comments and user-facing help text.

- **Documentation:**
  - Updated `.github/Property-Type-vs-Categories.md` with clear, lint-compliant standing order for future devs/AI.

- **Database & Schema Alignment:**
  - Identified and resolved a critical mismatch between frontend/backend field names and the database schema for property size fields.
  - Migrated from legacy `land_size_sqm`/`building_size_sqm` integer columns to new flexible `land_size`, `land_size_unit`, `building_size`, `building_size_unit` fields (decimal + unit).
  - Updated all relevant migrations, models, factories, and seeders to use the new fields.
  - Dropped deprecated columns from the schema for clarity and future-proofing.

- **Property Creation End-to-End Fix:**
  - Fixed property creation form and backend so that all required fields (including address, country/state/suburb, and new size fields) are correctly validated and saved.
  - Updated `StorePropertyRequest` and `UpdatePropertyRequest` to validate all new fields.
  - Ensured the React form coerces select values to the correct types and flattens address fields for backend compatibility.
  - Confirmed that property creation now works in both the UI and automated feature tests.

- **Testing & Debugging:**
  - Moved and updated property creation tests to Feature tests for proper context.
  - Fixed test setup to use correct foreign keys and required data.
  - Added missing fillable fields to models to allow mass assignment in tests and seeding.
  - Used log inspection and error tracing to quickly identify and resolve backend issues.

- **Documentation & Codebase Consistency:**
  - Updated `.github/BUILD_ORDER.md` and `.github/Property-Type-vs-Categories.md` to reflect the new schema and clarify the distinction between property types and categories.
  - Ensured all Copilot prompts, migration instructions, and model/field lists match the new schema and naming conventions.
  - Updated `properties-show.tsx` and related UI to display the new flexible fields and remove references to deprecated columns.

- **General Progress:**
  - Confirmed that the property creation workflow is robust, with validation, error handling, and flash messages working as intended.
  - The project is now in a stable state for further feature development, UI polish, and advanced business logic.

## Next Steps / Further Potential Work

- **UI/UX Polish:**
  - Add tooltips, inline validation, or more advanced help for complex fields.
  - Improve mobile responsiveness and accessibility.
  - Add loading states and better error handling for async actions.

- **Advanced Linking/Logic:**
  - Allow for more advanced linking between property type and categories (e.g., restrict available property types based on selected category).
  - Add support for category-specific dynamic attributes or feature sets.

- **Validation & Business Rules:**
  - Add stricter backend validation for category/property type consistency.
  - Enforce business rules for required fields based on property type or category.

- **Testing:**
  - Add automated tests for property creation, category/feature selection, and auto-selection logic.
  - Add E2E tests for the property creation workflow.

- **Performance & Refactoring:**
  - Optimize data loading and minimize unnecessary re-renders in the form.
  - Refactor for even clearer separation of concerns (custom hooks, smaller components).

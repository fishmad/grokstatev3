# Project Status (as of June 6, 2025)

## Completed Tasks (Micro-detailed)

- **Pagination & UI Fixes:**
  - Diagnosed and resolved pagination and UI issues on the property index page.
  - Ensured correct display and navigation for paginated property lists.

- **Property Creation Form Refactor:**
  - Migrated form to ShadCN/UI and Tailwind v4.1 for modern, accessible UI.
  - Implemented all required fields with validation and clear error display.
  - Added grouped features input as checkboxes, grouped by feature group.
  - Added dynamic key-value UI for dynamic attributes (JSON), with add/remove and live sync to form state.
  - Added slug input (optional, with backend auto-generation if left blank).
  - Added robust media upload input (multi-file).

- **Category & Feature Grouping:**
  - Implemented two-step category selection:
    - Step 1: Top-level category (radio, single-select)
    - Step 2: Subcategories (checkboxes, multi-select)
  - If no subcategories, allow selecting just the top-level category.
  - Grouped features by feature group for easier selection.

- **Seeding & Data Model Enhancements:**
  - Created and updated seeders for:
    - Features and feature groups (with correct groupings)
    - Categories and category types (with parent/child hierarchy)
    - Property types (flat, single-select)
    - Listing methods and listing statuses
  - Updated Eloquent models to support all relationships (feature group, category hierarchy, etc.)
  - Ensured all lookup tables are seeded and available to the frontend.

- **Backend/Controller Updates:**
  - Updated `PropertyController` to pass grouped and hierarchical data to the frontend for categories and features.
  - Ensured all lookup data is available for property creation/edit forms.

- **Auto-selection Logic & Infinite Loop Fix:**
  - Implemented auto-selection: when a single subcategory is selected and its name matches a property type, the property type is auto-selected.
  - Used string IDs for all dropdown/select values to avoid type mismatches.
  - Added robust guards in React effect to prevent infinite update loops (using `useRef` and value checks).
  - Ensured property type is cleared if no match or if multiple subcategories are selected.

- **UI/UX Clarity:**
  - Added help text to clarify the distinction between "Property Type" (structure, single-select) and "Categories" (market/use, hierarchical, multi-select).
  - Documented the distinction in both code comments and user-facing help text.

- **Documentation:**
  - Updated `.github/Property-Type-vs-Categories.md` with clear, lint-compliant standing order for future devs/AI.

- **Database & Schema Alignment:**
  - Identified and resolved a critical mismatch between frontend/backend field names and the database schema for property size fields.
  - Migrated from legacy `land_size_sqm`/`building_size_sqm` integer columns to new flexible `land_size`, `land_size_unit`, `building_size`, `building_size_unit` fields (decimal + unit).
  - Updated all relevant migrations, models, factories, and seeders to use the new fields.
  - Dropped deprecated columns from the schema for clarity and future-proofing.

- **Property Creation End-to-End Fix:**
  - Fixed property creation form and backend so that all required fields (including address, country/state/suburb, and new size fields) are correctly validated and saved.
  - Updated `StorePropertyRequest` and `UpdatePropertyRequest` to validate all new fields.
  - Ensured the React form coerces select values to the correct types and flattens address fields for backend compatibility.
  - Confirmed that property creation now works in both the UI and automated feature tests.

- **Testing & Debugging:**
  - Moved and updated property creation tests to Feature tests for proper context.
  - Fixed test setup to use correct foreign keys and required data.
  - Added missing fillable fields to models to allow mass assignment in tests and seeding.
  - Used log inspection and error tracing to quickly identify and resolve backend issues.

- **Documentation & Codebase Consistency:**
  - Updated `.github/BUILD_ORDER.md` and `.github/Property-Type-vs-Categories.md` to reflect the new schema and clarify the distinction between property types and categories.
  - Ensured all Copilot prompts, migration instructions, and model/field lists match the new schema and naming conventions.
  - Updated `properties-show.tsx` and related UI to display the new flexible fields and remove references to deprecated columns.

- **General Progress:**
  - Confirmed that the property creation workflow is robust, with validation, error handling, and flash messages working as intended.
  - The project is now in a stable state for further feature development, UI polish, and advanced business logic.

## Completed Tasks (Tonight)

- **Address & Nested Data Handling:**
  - Fixed backend validation and controller logic to use nested `address` fields (e.g., `address.street_name`, `address.suburb_id`).
  - Updated `StorePropertyRequest` to move `suburb_id` from root into `address` for backend consistency.
  - Ensured all address fields are correctly validated, saved, and displayed end-to-end.
  - Confirmed backend and frontend are now fully aligned for address and location data structures.

- **React/TypeScript Robustness:**
  - Refactored `AddressAutofill` usage to be fully type-safe and controlled, preventing runtime errors.
  - Added type conversions and mapping helpers to bridge between Google API, form state, and backend expectations.
  - Fixed all TypeScript errors related to address and price forms, including strict typing for `PriceForm` and `AddressForm`.
  - Ensured all form fields (including price, address, and location IDs) are robustly managed and validated.

- **End-to-End Property Creation:**
  - Successfully created properties with all required fields, including nested address and location IDs, from the UI.
  - Backend now saves and displays all property data as expected, with correct relationships and eager loading.
  - Error handling and validation messages are clear and user-friendly throughout the flow.

- **Debugging & Logging:**
  - Used log inspection and debug output to trace and resolve backend issues quickly.
  - Confirmed that all controller and request logic is now robust to both legacy and new frontend payloads.

- **Address & Google Maps Integration (Today):**
  - Refactored the address step in the property creation wizard to use plain text inputs for country, state, and suburb, with robust fallback and validation for missing or unknown locations.
  - Enhanced Google Maps/Places integration: ensured all address fields (including unit number, region name, and municipality) are auto-populated and editable, and kept in sync with the map/autocomplete.
  - Updated `GoogleAddressMapInput` to allow mapping of Google address components (e.g., administrative_area_level_1/2/3) to form fields, and enabled recycling of the "Site Name" field for municipality or state as needed.
  - Ensured that address fields and relational IDs (country_id, state_id, suburb_id) are set when possible, but gracefully handle missing or unknown values for partial/incomplete listings.
  - Discussed and implemented backend and frontend validation strategies for missing address IDs, allowing properties to be created with incomplete address data and enabling later correction.
  - Improved frontend robustness: all code now gracefully handles missing IDs and avoids runtime errors if address/location data is incomplete.

- **Documentation & Codebase Consistency:**
  - Updated `.github/BUILD_ORDER.md` and `.github/Property-Type-vs-Categories.md` to reflect the new schema and clarify the distinction between property types and categories.
  - Ensured all Copilot prompts, migration instructions, and model/field lists match the new schema and naming conventions.
  - Updated `properties-show.tsx` and related UI to display the new flexible fields and remove references to deprecated columns.

- **General Progress:**
  - Confirmed that the property creation workflow is robust, with validation, error handling, and flash messages working as intended.
  - The project is now in a stable state for further feature development, UI polish, and advanced business logic.

## Issues Still Encountered / To Do Tomorrow

- **Final End-to-End Test:**
  - Run a full property creation and edit cycle, including media upload, to confirm all edge cases are handled.
  - Double-check that all address/location fields are saved and displayed correctly in all views.

- **Frontend Address/ID Sync:**
  - Ensure that when a user selects or autofills an address, the correct suburb/state/country IDs are always resolved and set in form state.
  - Add more robust error handling for failed location resolution or missing IDs.

- **UI/UX Polish:**
  - Add tooltips, inline validation, and help text for address/location fields.
  - Improve mobile responsiveness and accessibility for the property creation form.

- **Testing:**
  - Add/expand automated feature tests for property creation, especially for address and price validation.
  - Add E2E tests for the full property workflow.

- **Performance & Refactoring:**
  - Optimize form state updates and minimize unnecessary re-renders.
  - Refactor address/location logic into a custom hook or smaller components for clarity.
